About

This FAQ is not just my work. It  has  been   a  collection  of  many  years  
of   player's  experiences  and discoveries other than  my own. And whilst  
much of the information  in this FAQ is indeed  my own  original work, people  
who contributed to  this FAQ  will be credited.

It's been a long time  since I have worked on this FAQ,  and whilst I have 
been active in  the community it  has taken this long  to bring myself  to 
literally rewrite this FAQ.  In fact it was only  when I first played  the 
iPhone version that I decided  so, where this new format  will be used in a  
dedicated FAQ for that platform.

Enjoy your playthrough, and best of luck on your challenge!
 
>-2-<
Introduction

A low-level  game (LLG),  as self-explanatory as  it is,  is a  playthrough 
at very low  levels. In fact  this FAQ will  detail currently the  lowest 
reported levels possible  in this  game. As  of now  I am  calling out  to 
computer/macro programmers, see  section  >-30-<, to help  me  work on find  
even  lower still paths  for finishing  this game,  or  even people  who  can 
give  me advice  on manipulating excel sufficiently. Many Thanks.

This guide will detail  how to complete all areas and  side quests, and even 
all the optional bosses.

As of now the lowest levels currently possible are:

Crono: 1
Marle: 4
Lucca: 15
Frog : 15
Robo : 16
Ayla : 20
Magus: 37

And this FAQ will explain how to achieve this.

As a  rule for  sake of  maximizing the  difficulty of  this challenge  and 
for certain  sentiment.  Magus should  be  excluded  from  any fighting  
party  and Chrono included wherever possible.

It  is recommended  you  play at  least  one regular  playthrough  of the  
game before attempting  this. The reasons  are because it  takes about that  
long to become sufficiently  adept with  the mechanics  and controls  of the  
game, and also  this  FAQ  will  not  go  into  detail  with  storyline  
elements  unless necessary. To  finish this  FAQ you  will inevitably need  
to become  even more skilled at  the game, factors such as  timing, memory 
and  precise movement are crucial to  the challenge. Don't be intimidated  
however, this is  far from the hardest low-level  RPG challenge, after  this 
you might  want to try  FF-XII or FF-III/VI, good luck with those, good luck!

Hints & Tips, basic LLG strategy 101

-Game Settings

Maximize the amount  of time you have  to press buttons and  minimize time 
lose by scrolling  the menu by  setting the battle speed  to 8 (slowest)  and 
cursor to memory. Also, of  course set your battle mode to Wait. We  will 
need to play around with  the battle speed  later to manipulate  some 
mechanics, but  I will explicitly tell you when that's the case, keep these 
setting as default.

-Saving

This  guide will  not mention  it  as much,  but save  wherever possible.  
Save before entering  new areas and  after completing  them. Keep multiple  
saves so that any  late mistakes (not  buying enough revives before  65 
Million BC  is a common mistake of mine) can be corrected.

-Avoiding encounters

All but one  of Chrono Triggers encounters  are not random, they  all happen 
in preset  locations  with  preset  triggers  and monsters,  part  of  why  
Chrono Trigger  is  such  an  amazing  game. As  a  result  many  of  the  
encounters, including inescapable ones  can be avoided by simply avoiding  
the trigger. All inescapable battles  which can  be avoided  will be 
detailed  in the  FAQ, but many others  can be  avoided by simply  not 
touching said  monster or  just not getting  too close,  take looping  paths  
away from  monsters you  can see  and you'll avoid 60% of encounters, just 
like that.

-Running from encounters

If the  battle can  be run  from, you can  do so  just by  holding the  L&R, 
if using an  emulator you  can also  set both these  buttons to  a single  
key for convenience sake

-Treasure Hunting

There is a LOT of treasure in Chrono  Trigger, so much so that  you will 
never really need to  buy a single piece of  equipment to win the game,  and 
doing so anyway is probably  a waste of money.  Your ability to earn  money 
from battles before  the  Wallet  is  limited  to   just  those  forced  
encounters  and  so scavenging as much  as possible is essential to being  
successful in this game. You will  need a huge number  of Mid-Tonics &  
Revives for Magus' fort  and for Reptite Palace,  and like it  or not, 
you're  going to have  to pay for  all of them!

-Referring to other FAQ's GameFAQ's is full  of great  FAQ's  by other  
authors, and  I would  recommend using them  for information  if you  ever 
become  lost at  any point.  This FAQ will attempt to keep  you on track as 
much as possible  without you doing this, but there is no shame in doing so. 
Some particularly useful FAQ's include:

-Stat-Boosting Tabs

Tabs are as  far as I am aware  crucial to your ultimate success  in this 
game. So far all  battles including all sidequests  except for all of  the 
Black Omen and  Lavos have been  completed  without any tabs.  But  as far 
as  I  am aware Lavos himself  is impossible without at  least boosting your  
character's speed or using Magus. More on this in section 5.1

>-4.1-< 
Game Mechanics:

While  I  will  not  attempt  to  replicate  DragonKnight  Zero  &  
G*Paladin's brilliant  FAQ,  I  will  detail  some   of  the  most  crucial  
mechanics  for completing a LLG.

-Experience Mechanics
Your  characters  join  the  party  at   predetermined  levels,  they  are  
not influenced at all by the current party member's levels.

Crono: 1
Marle: 1
Lucca: 2
Frog : 5
Robo : 10
Ayla : 18
Magus: 37

On top  of that  the characters  will also  require the  maximal exp  reach 
the next level.

Experience is not  divided across party members like most  RPG's. That is, 
form your  experience if  an  enemy  earns  1000 experience  and  you have  
2  party members alive the  experience is divided and both characters  would 
receive 500 each. This  is not the  case for Chrono  Trigger, for  if an 
enemy  yields 1000 experience, then  all characters  alive will receive  that 
much,  regardless of how many  are dead.  So to minimize  experience gain, 
only  1 character  can be alive at the end of each battle.

Party members  outside the  party receive  75% of  the experience  those 
inside the  party  do.   And  experience  'spillover'  is  written   off,  
hence  it's impossible for a  character to level up  twice outside the main  
party. This is a crucial  mechanic and will  affect how  experience is 
shuffled  between party members to  abuse this  as much as  possible. This 
means  that if  for example, Lucca requires just  5 exp to gain a  level, and 
she is outside  the main party and  you  fight a  battle  which  yields  1000 
exp.  If  you  do the  math  she potentially should gain  750 experience, but 
will actually only  gain the 5 exp for the next  level. That's a whole 745  
exp written off. Just  like that. 

Also, on  a more subtle  note, the game rounds  down any experience  gained 
and does not count  fractions as far as I  have tested. Hard to  actually 
abuse but again calling help aforementioned.

>-5.1-<
Tabs Discussion

I  have seen  this topic  debated  with varying  degrees of  vigour, and  
almost always stemming  from the  question 'How  come youâ€™re  characters are  
hitting so much damage  at such low  levels?'. Part of the  answer to this  
question comes down to  the  damage calculation mechanics,  which  you can 
refer  to  the game mechanics FAQ  to understand. The  other part is  usually 
that we  have boosted our  characters  with  various  boosting  Tabs. For  
those  purists  out  there though, I  can confirm,  this challenge  is 
possible  all the  way up  till the second and third  forms of Lavos without 
the  use of a single tab,  and the use of such  will only be pushed  upon 
entering the Black  Omen. So far I  have had success completing  the game  by 
giving  Robo just five  Speed Tabs  and nobody anything else. This FAQ  will 
not show you exactly how to do  it this way, but if you are determined you  
should be able to work it out  on your own the hints I give along the way.

Now, very importantly,  if you plan on  tackling Ocean Palace Lavos  (as I 
will expect given the  massive interest seen in QHovrik's excellent  LP on 
Something Awful), then  you will need use,  a lot, of tabs  whether you like 
it  or not, and hence I suggest  you pick up at least all the Speed  Tabs you 
possibly can, in order to be able to max our Crono, Marle, Robo & Ayla's 
Speed.

For the  purposes of this guide,  you will be  Maxing out Marle &  Ayla's 
speed at first chance and  bringing Crono & Robo up to 15, the  latter two 
because of major timing issues with the Lavos forms.

>-5.2-<
Missable Tabs list

I have pulled this  list from the Tabs FAQ and left  the ones directly 
relevant to a  LLQ (missable ones which  we can't get  because we don't have  
charm yet, for example, I  have left out. I suggest  you check this list  
before you enter each new  area, so  you know where  to look.  For a 
complete  tab list  see the dedicated FAQ,  which will include all the  non-
missable tabs. You  do NOT need to  collect every single  tab  on the way,  
you  can live without  a  couple of power,  and without  a  single  magic  
tab for  that  instance, so  don't  kill yourself trying to get 1500 points 
in the bike race, for instance.

The areas  with missable  tabs are few  and far between,  also cross  check 
all the areas  you enter  with the  original FAQ to  save yourself  time 
revisiting these areas later.

600 AD - Magus' Castle
After Defeating Flea - 1 Magic Tab South East of the hole that Ozzie makes - 
1 Magic Tab

12000 BC
Enhasaâ€™s  Water,Wind,Fire;  Defeat   the  6  Nus  -  1  Speed   and  Magic  
Tab Kajar, northeast room - 1 Speed Tab Scratch the Nu at Zeal Castle - 1 
Magic Tab

12000 BC
South of the beast's nest - 1 Power Tab Beast's Nest, charm Mud Imp - 1 Speed 
Tab Mount of Woe, before the Giga Gaia - 1 Magic Tab Mount of Woe, charm Giga 
Gaia - 1 Speed Tab Ocean Palace, in the elevator, go down then up - 1 Magic 
Tab Ocean Palace, charm Golem Twins - 2 Magic Tabs Northeast of Blackbird, 
after getting everyone's equipment back - 1 Magic Tab

2300 AD
Death Peak, right of the first tree - 1 Power Tab Geno Dome, behind the red 
laser - 1 Magic Tab Geno Dome, southeast of the long passage - 1 Power Tab 
Geno Dome, in the "switch" of the secret passage - 1 Magic Tab Geno Dome, 
near the last Poyozo Doll - 1 Speed Tab

600 AD
37. Sunken Desert, charm the Retiniteâ€™s core - 1 Speed Tab 38. Defeat 
Retinite, then come back to the first room - 1 Power Tab

So with all this aside, and without further ado, on to the main challenge!

**>-6-<***
1000 A.D Crono's Home
**********

Get everything from Crono's  Mum & Mayors Manor. Also there is  a Power Tab 
in Guardia Forest.  After meeting  Marle make  sure you  return the  girls 
kitten, refuse to sell the  pendant, don't eat the old man's lunch  and wait 
for Marle. This will ensure  you get 7 innocent votes  and a handsome reward  
as a result. There is  nothing else  to do here,  you can't fight  anything 
either.  So just continue to the teleporter and you'll be transported to 600 
AD.

*********
600 A.D Truce Canyon
*********

Here you'll face your first forced encounter.

**********
Imp x 3
6 Exp
**********

A straightforward  fight, these are  the only exp  Crono will absorb  this 
game and aren't enough to level him up.

encounters collect the Powerglove & Tonic then head into the Market, buy 
about  20  Tonics (more  than  enough  for  the  next  section) now  head  
into Guardia Forest.

Besides the Power  Tab here, there's also a  bush here with a  monster who 
will drop a shelter  when you go up to  it. Leaving and re-entering  the 
forest will yield a shelter  each time. So take  this opportunity and farm  
about 15. While you  could potentially  sell these  you really  don't need  
to, there's  enough money  elsewhere. Just  keep these  for personal  use. 
In  future whenever  you pass through this area,  it's convenient to visit 
the bush  for a free shelter :-).

Ransack the  castle for all  its treasure  and after the  subsequent 
storyline scenes you'll  gain Lucca  (Level 2).  Time for the  cathedral! 
Give  Lucca the Bandana and Crono the Power Glove.

**>-7-<***
Cathedral
**********

Enter, find the hairpin and you'll face a forced encounter

**********
Nagette x 4 
32 Exp
**********

These will  likely require 1  or 2 Tonics,  but have Crono  & Lucca kill  the 
2 Nagettes closest to  Lucca first then focus on  the other 2, let  Crono die 
and Lucca finishes  this, healing  as necessary.  Their slow  spell is  
annoying so don't cut it too close with Tonics. After Frog joins you save 
outside.

The cathedral has  only one encounter that  you can avoid but  cannot run 
from, and  that  encounter  is on  the  stairs  with  the  red carpet, and  
it is only triggered if  you try to run on  the red carpet  without touch-
encountering the diablos before it.  So to be safe,  encounter all monsters 
on  the walkways and the diablos before (running  from all of them) before 
trying to  run up the red carpet.  Get all  the  treasures  except  the ones  
in  Magus' shrine  and  the Nagette Bromide  including the Steel Sabre  and 
Power Tab. The  other treasures you  can  get  later.  The  area  after  the  
stairs  contains  no  inescapable encounters  except the  one in  the organ  
room which  is forced.  Get all  the treasures,  optimize your equipment  
and  heal your characters  with  slurp and you will face..

*********
Hench x3 + Diablos x2 
53 Exp
*********

Just attack  and use Frog's slurp on  himself to conserve  resources, have 
Frog absorb this by having  Crono and Lucca killed off near the  end. Now 
proceed to Yakra,   picking  up   everything   on  the   way.   Optimize  
your   equipment Pick up  the IronSword (Frog)  play the organ  and head 
straight  towards Yakra (avoiding  the  monsters),  heal  with a  shelter.  
Optimize  your  characters, learning  frog  with   his  original  armour  and  
accessory.   Give  Crono  the Powerglove and Lucca the Bandana.

*********
Yakra  
50 Exp  
920 Hp
*********

Yakra, a  very straightforward boss once  you discipline yourself  with 
healing yourself appropriately with  Tonics/Slurps. In this case, heal  only 
Chrono and Frog,  as Yakra  only  does his  counter  attack when  there  are 
3  characters alive.  When Yakra gets  low,  say below 200  Hp,  let Crono 
die  off  and Frog solo. Keep Frog above  70 Hp at all times and there is  
nothing to worry about. Frog will absorb this 50 exp.

After the  following scenes you'll be  back at the  castle, but now you  can 
go back to the Cathedral  here and pick up all the items you  missed out on 
before now that  the place is  void of monsters.  The most  important of 
which  is the Speed Belt! Before  you go back to 1000 A.D.  Make sure you buy 
so  you have 30 Tonics, this  should  be enough for  the  next few sections,  
there  is nothing worse than running out of tonics when fighting the dragon 
tank!

**>-8-<***
1000 A.D - Guardia Prison
**********

Head  straight for  Guardia Castle,  there  is nothing  else to  do here.  
When asked who  initiated contact, admit  that you did  and deny being  
attracted by Marle's  wealth. Once you  are  in jail you  should  have 6 
ethers  for  you if everything went  well, otherwise donâ€™t  worry about it,  
save and heal  and wait out the 3 days.  Every encounter in this jail you 
cannot run  from, but you can avoid all of them.  After Lucca saves you grab 
the Bronzemail  and head out, al. the  fallen guards  outside  this room  
will  have  a mid-tonic  for you  when prompted, make  sure you do  so! 
Speaking of  Mid-Tonics, SAVE Fritz!  Doing so will  net you  10 Mid-Tonics  
later  head up  and  around (do  not take  bottom corridor as  this leads to 
inescapable  encounters), go across bridge  and head straight  through to  
the  next  room which  has  2  inescapable but  avoidable shield monsters 
then go left into the next room, grab the shelter then head back into the 
room with the 2 monsters.


Now  to avoid  these  2 line  yourself  up right in between  the  two and  
run through, you  will avoid this  encounter, head left  and head through  
the hold and eventually reach a  room with a Lode Sword!! (Crono) and  1500 
G, come back up now  head right  & upstairs.  Pick up  the 5  Mid Tonics  off 
the  guard and save,  if your  using an  emulator save  state too,  now 
equip  Crono with  the Speed Belt  or Power  Glove and  Lucca with the  Speed 
Belt  or Bandana  - make sure Crono has his Lode Sword equipped.

**********
Dragon Tank 
40 Exp
Head - 600 Hp
Grinder - 208 HP
Body - 266 Hp
**********

Crono should be able to  do 80 damage, Lucca 35, open out  all out on the 
HEAD, now the battle begins.

The head  is Capable  of healing  each part  of the  body 70  damage 
(sometimes faster than you can  damage it), so that must go down first,  the 
head and body can also attack, the head does a fire  based attack & the body 
fires missiles - (which I found was  usually Crono), so after initial blitz  
have Lucca focus on healing  herself &  Crono  with  tonics  and Crono  
attacks  head. Do  NOT  use Cyclone. AFTER  the Tank  released its  energy  
(running you  over..) have  both Crono &  Lucca heal themselves  with a Tonic 
or  two & continue  attacking till head gone (40 or less Hp - not safe BTW). 
Do same with Grinder, keep Crono alive for the body. When the  Head &  
Grinder are  gone the  body will  counterattack with  a laser (30 damage),  
keep Crono  on decent  health until youâ€™re  sure you've  taken most of its 
600  
Hp, then let Crono  die from its counter-attacks  and finish things up with 
Lucca - who will absorb the Exp & Grow to level 3. Escape the castle, Collect 
Marle and escape to 2300 AD.

**>-9.1-<***
2300 A.D
***********

You arrive in Bangor  Done, in the room you arrive in is  a sealed door, 
behind it is the Wallet, but.. We got another half  of a game to play before 
we can go through this,  so this  means you  still got  lots of  monsters to  
avoid etc.. hehe.

Head straight to  Lab 16 and go through  it, make sure you  grab the 
Berserker, Lode  Sword and  Lode Bow  along with  all the  other chests  and 
running  from every encounter (including  the Mutants), there are no  forced 
encounters here, don't worry!

Anyways, you CAN go to  the Sewer Access, head right and grab  the 600 G in 
the Chest (the  fight is  escapable), this  isnâ€™t necessary but  every bit  
of cash helps, return back to Arris Dome. You should be nearly  empty on 
Tonics right now, go buy  about 20-30, this will be plenty for now, save and 
then head downstairs. Head  towards the  food storage,  stop  before you  
reach the  room before  the storage (the one with the boss encounter).

Give Lucca the Iron Helm, Speed Belt  & Madain Suit, Marle the best of 
whatever you  got left  (with the  Bandana) and  Crono the  Bronze Mail  & 
Power  Glove. Now run straight through  the room and youâ€™ll encounter a Boss  
(if you wait in the room a bit youâ€™ll encounter an Inescapable battle.. Hence 
run through)

*********
Guardian & Bits x2
300 Exp
Guardian - 1200 Hp
Bits - 200 Hp
*********

This is the  first & last battle Marle  does exactly the same  damage as 
Crono, both of which do 40-43 damage each. If you  attack the  body while  
both bits  are alive,  they counter  with Delta Attack on  all 3, which will  
probably ruin you,  attack the body with  one bit alive  and  theyâ€™ll use  
amplifire  on  the  attacking character  (45  Damage), amplifire  is  also  
used  as  a  normal attack  with  only  1  bit  is  alive. To beat this boss, 
I took an all-out approach and attacked each bit with all 3 (and  healing 
with  first available  character is  health fell  below 45)  then blitzing 
the body. If  youâ€™re playing on emulator save state  after you kill both bits, 
have  attacked the body  as much as  you can  and has just  revived both, 
because you need both  Marle & Crono dead so Lucca can finish  off the body, 
if not keep CAREFUL track of his Hp (use a piece of paper). Keep attacking  
and healing if Crono or  Marle dies donâ€™t  bother reviving them (if you  have 
any revives  at this point),  if both die  and your about  300 or more short 
of killing the body you should restart. Make sure Crono &  Marle die then the 
Main Body is at  about 100 Hp (preferably by attacking  the body when  thereâ€™
s only 1  bit left to  deliberately activate the counter-attack)  then 
finish  off  the remaining  bit then  the  body off  with Lucca, who will 
absorb the full 300 Exp.

Anyway after this  battle, Lucca will level  up twice to level  5, your 
current levels should be:


Crono: Level 1
Marle: Level 3
Lucca: level 5

Run  through, after  the  scenes  grab  the Mid-Ether  now  go catch  the  
rat, activate the console  & head  through, grab  the Mid-Ether and  watch 
Lavos  Destroy the world. Head out  and REST IN THE  ENERTON, this will be  
your last chance to  heal for free  until  you  reach the  end  of  time,  
save  and  head over  to  Lab  32. Grab the Mid Tonic & race Johnny & head to 
Proto Dome, SAVE OUTSIDE.

Youâ€™ll enter another inescapable battle

**********
Buggers x3
54 Exp
100 Hp each
**********

Take out  the bugger closest to  Lucca and weaken  the two near Marle  & 
Crono, let Crono &  Marle get  killed (if youâ€™re  on emulator press  the 
turbo  
button) then finish up with Lucca who will gain another level. Now I 
recommend if your using normal  game to save outside again then re-enter, if 
emulator save state.

Ahead of you are 4 inescapable but  avoidable buggers, walk (donâ€™t run) 
towards and hug the wall in  front of them (bottom end of the screen) and â€˜
slideâ€™ across holding down and right, then up then right to  get to the 
stairs then down and right to go down them. Do not dash at any point of this 
process, or the encounter will trigger.

Phew, now go up and meet one of your best characters ROBO!

Take Robo, Crono and Lucca with you, you will need to dodge this irritating 
encounter once again, and a few more timed after this too, but this encounter 
is cake compared with some we'll need to deal with later.

**>-9.2-<***
2400 AD - Factory
**********

As  you enter  and  when  Robo  activates the  console  youâ€™ll be  thrown  
into another forced encounter.

**********
Acid x1

**********

You're going  to have to  wait for this  Acid to  hack through Robo's  200+ 
Hp, use Cure Beams/Auras  on Marle to save  on Tonics. Marle will  absorb 
this, the experience from  this battle is  essentially written off  by the 
next  2 forced encounters.

Now  most of  this factory  is  optional, and  you're  going to  need to  
skip virtually  all of  it  the part  of  the  factory from  the  right 
elevator  is littered with  inescapable encounters.  You can  grab the  Robin 
Bow  from that room, but do  not try for anything else.  Now go through the  
left elevator and save your game. Run from the next  encounter at the console 
and head  downstairs, around and to the  next console.  Now, activating  the  
console triggers  a forced  encounter with a random number  of Acids and 
Alkalines with anywhere  between 0-5 of each with a  total of  5 monsters.  
Now after scrutinizing  the experience  gains by calculations,  you can  
afford  to have  at  most 3  Alkalines  in this  battle (Alkalines give  45 
exp each,  and Acids 33) without  any effect on  your final levels. If you  
encounter 4 or 5, you  must reset and try again.  It should not take too  
many attempts to  accomplish this, and  the previous version  of this guide 
required you  to exclusively encounter 5 acids  only (!) which was  a 1 in 32 
shot!

**********
Acids & Alkalines

Pretty straightforward and  they should have no problems killing  off Crono 
and Marle. Robo will learn Laser Spin after this :-).

After this  pick up the Titan  Arm & Vest. Now  you must leave the  factory 
and switch Marle  for Lucca, and make  sure you save  outside the dome as  
you will need to weave around the forced encounter with those 4 buggers, 
twice, again.

Now optimize  Lucca with the best  gear you have  sans the weapon and  give 
her the Speed  Belt. Give Crono  the best of what's  left and very  
importantly the Berserker, de-equip Robo  if you need in order to  accomplish 
this. Now continue on to  the switch,  saving on the  way. Lucca's  best 
weapon so  far is  in the chest besides  the  panel where you  must  input 
the password,  equip  it right away and the password is  X A B Y, the fight 
with the R-Series is tough.

**********
R-Series x6
480 Exp
150 Hp each
**********

You probably remember  having a heyday with Crono's Cyclone,  Lucca's Fire 
Line and even  their first dual tech  Fire Whirl. This is  not going to work  
for us though, our characters are  just too weak to heal fast  enough without 
dying if they  manually attack.  This  is  where the  Berserker  comes  in. 
The  berserker grants Crono  Auto-Protect status, and effectively  reduces the 
damage  he takes as  well as  putting him  in auto-pilot.  Now this  battle 
just  comes down  to healing constantly  with Lucca  and letting  Crono hack  
away at  the R- Series. After  3-4 are  down stop  healing  Crono. You  
should  be able  to have  Crono killed  off with  maybe  2  heavily damaged  
R-Series  left,  which Lucca  can, barely, finish  off herself. It may  well 
take a  few resets to get  the timing right  here, but  you get  it  
eventually. Lucca  absorbs an  obscene 480  exp, eurgh.

Eventually you'll find yourself at the end of time.

**>-10-<***
End of Time & 1000 AD - Medina
**********
Meso Mail, Speed Tab, Magic Tab

Now speak to Gaspar, and learn to  use magic, you can even have your 
characters learn their  dual techs, although  their usefulness  is rather 
limited  at this stage. You  can heal  for free  here, now  take this  good 
opportunity  to have Crono and Marle K.O'd, to make the next forced encounter 
much faster.

Now before you go  straight to 1000 AD, take the 65000000  BC gate, exit 
Mystic Mountain and  enter the Dactyl Nest. Run  from every encounter  as 
usual (there are none that  cannot be run from) and here  you can grab a Mid  
Ether but also more importantly  an early Meso  Mail! :-)   Return to  the 
gate and  head down the gate to Medina Village.

When you  arrive here you should  head into the  Elders House and grab  the 
two tabs there  table, this is useful, go upstairs  and you can also  grab a 
Magic Tab. Also raid the blue pyramid for an Ether.*** Head back  out and 
speak  to Melchior, from  him buy  until you have  99 Tonics (because they're 
that cheap)  & 20  Mid Tonics (because  theyâ€™re not  so cheap, but 
necessary). When you enter Heckran's cave, you'll be thrown into another 
forced encounter.

**********
Hench x2

**********

Wait for Crono & Marle to be killed, finish with Robo.

Items: 2x Ether, Mid Ether, Magicscarf

There  are  no  more  forced  encounters  in   this  cave,  you  can  run  
from everything, so  sack  this place for  what  it's worth. At  the  
save point swap Robo for Lucca to have a party of Crono, Marle & Lucca, heal 
with a Shelter.

Equip them:

Lucca: Best Helm, Meso Mail & Speed Belt 
Marle: 2nd Best Helm, Titan Vest & Magic Scarf 
Crono: Anything

With this setup both Marle and Lucca should have a modest 8 speed.

You're going  to need  to keep  reasonable track  of this  bosses' HP  here, 
as Lucca cannot  1 on 1 against  Heckran for very long,  yet she must be  the 
lone Exp Absorber.

**********
Heckran
250 Exp
2100 Hp
**********

This fight is pretty tough, just remember that only Magic deals any damage.

Heckran starts out with the following attack pattern:

Bubble (40-45 damage)
Bubble (40-45 damage)
Cyclone (80 Damage to Marle, 95-100 To Lucca) Counter Attacking Phase (a few 
turns worth) Repeat

Only use  Mid Tonics  when you  need to  in order  to conserve  resources, 
just ensure that Marle  Hp is always full,  Luccaâ€™s is above 90  before 
Heckran uses Cyclone here,  by having  the most  immediate character  heal. 
Contraire  to the last edition,  there is no  point in using Antipode  here, 
as the  2 individual Fire and  Ice  spells do identical  damage,  do just 
damage  Heckran  with both Marle  and Lucca  with  their magic  spells.  
Chrono can  help  too while  he's alive, but don't bother reviving him when 
he does die.

When he enters his  Counter-Attack phase heal up to full  HP with Tonics, 
don't bother with Ethers

Before long heâ€™ll enter a VERY deadly cycle

Cyclone (80 Damage to Marle, 95-100 To Lucca) Cyclone (80 Damage to Marle, 95-
100 To Lucca) Yes Indeed! Attack (75-77 to Marle 67-70 Lucca) Counter Attack 
Phase (a few turns worth) Repeat

You must  play very  defensively here,  as Heckran is  fast enough  to get  in 
2 moves to your 1  here, and as you can calculate, not even  Lucca with her 
early Meso Mail  can survive  2 hits in  a row.  From full MP,  both Marle  
and Lucca should  be  able  to  do  barely  enough  damage  to  kill  
Heckran,  literally finishing with  the last spell,  or at most  1 or 2  
spells more than  that. So you can use this as your rough guide to finishing 
the battle.

First exhaust Marle's remaining MP left with the following attack pattern:

"Brief Counter-Attack Break" Marle immediately uses Ice, Lucca waits with her 
turn ready. Cyclone 1 If it  hits Marle, have Lucca  immediately use a  Mid-
Tonic on her, if  it hits Lucca, immediately have her use a normal Tonic on 
herself. Cyclone 2 You should get  Marleâ€™s turn now, cast Ice,  if this 
Cyclone hit  Lucca and had already hit  her before as well,  use a Mid-
Tonic,  if not use a  Normal Tonic. If it hits Marle Use a Mid-Tonic. Yes 
Indeed! If  you  manage  it,  you  may  just   be  able  to  squeeze  a  
Fire  in  here "Go Ahead Try & Attack" Heal fully with Tonics and wait with 
turns available

After Marle  runs out  of MP, repeat  the above attack  pattern but  with 
Marle and  Lucca  switching  roles,  their  speed is  identical  so  this  
should  be straightforward. The only difference is Marle will not get an 
attack in,  just have  her heal with  a Tonic. Heckran  should fall  on 
Lucca's last  spell before  running out  of MP,  a  good time  to finish  
this is  just before he enters  his counterattack phase, have Lucca ethered  
once before this (so she  has 12  MP), have Marle  die off  and Lucca cast  
Fire just  after the 'Yes Indeed!'  attack,  if this isnâ€™t  enough  to finish 
him  then  another Fire spell whilst  he is  in his  counterattack phase  
should most  certainly finish the job.

600 AD - Zenan Bridge + Denadoro Mtâ€™s
***********

After the  following scenes,  grab the Taban  Vest, which will  not be  of 
very much  use  but,   meh.  Also  collect  your  10  Mid-tonics     off  
Fritz  for saving him. the proceed to 600AD, healing at the EOT along the way.

At the  market in  600 AD, get  10 Revives  and buy as  many Mid-Tonics  as 
you can afford without selling anything off.

Head  to Zenan  Bridge,  talk to  the  people  there then  head  to the  
castle (collecting your  free shelters too), collect your  Jerky & Power  
Tab, head to the bridge again, save.

On this  bridge are  a Series of  3 forced encounters,  enter Zenan  bridge 
and talk to the Commander, then talk to him again for a Gold Helm.

Have in your party Robo, Marle & Crono

**********
Deceased x2 - 106 exp
**********

Wait until  Crono  and Robo are  knocked  out after both  attacking  Ozzie 
once (healing Marle  when necessary, now have Marle  attack Ozzie for  the 
3rd time to break his spell and end the fight.

Marle absorbs all 106 Exp, which will not be enough to Level her up.

A/N: Thanks CyberSarkany for telling me this strategy.

Heal Robo with his Cure Beam.

Same strategy as before, except Robo absorbs instead.

Leave the bridge, save and heal. Set up your characters accordingly.

Robo : Gold Helm, Meso mail, Speed Belt, Best Weap

Zombor
Top - 1000
Bottom - 800
350 Exp
**********

This battle  isnâ€™t very  difficult at all,  you will want  to track  the 
bottom half of Zombor's HP.

To begin:
Have  Crono attack  or use  Cyclone  (tracking the  bottoms  HP if  you do  
so) Marle use Ice on top Robo use Rocket punch on top

The top should fall before it gets a  chance to use its Doom, Doom, Doom 
attack (if it  does donâ€™t  bother reviving  or healing, just  keep attacking  
top with Robo  (the   other  2  should   die),  donâ€™t  bother   
healing/reviving  fallen characters, heal Robo with a Mid Ether if MP busted.

Blitz the bottom until  it says 'Doom Doom Doom Doom', keeping  track of its 
HP as you  go along. Now  Zombor tends to glitch  here, which can  be 
(grudgingly) solved by  healing one of  the characters with a  Tonic. Doom 
Doom  Doom always targets the player with  most HP, which will usually be 
Robo,  and will one hit K.O. him, so  make sure another player is  alive when 
it does  so. It's attacks are very  weak, dealing  less than 30  Hp, do 
healing  should be  minimal. When Zombor gets close  to dying (<240HP, or  3 
hits from Robo),  have the remaining characters die  off whilst healing  Robo 
and finish  it off, absorbing  all 350 Exp. No Problem.

Items: Mid Tonic, Shelter, Magic Scarf Now you  have access  to the  bottom 
half of  your continent  of 600  AD, don't bother  healing anyone  except  
Robo,  not even  for  MP.  After the  following scenes  with  Frog  
(ransacking  the  places as  per  usual,  nothing  here  is inescapable). 

Head into Cursed Woods,  grab the Mid Tonic, Shelter and  your 2nd Magic 
Scarf, talk to  Frog then leave.  Keep Robo in  the party, put  him at 
position  3 and enter Denadoro mountains.

Grab the  300G and  continue up towards  the ladder and  youâ€™ll enter  2 
forced battles.

**********
Goblin

It's a pain  to actually have your  characters killed off, thatâ€™s  why we 
didn't heal  from before,  but you  know  the drill,  Robo absorbs  this, 
after  which you'll be knocked into another forced battle.

**********
Ogan
32 Exp
**********

You'll probably need to  heal here, but just keep attacking  him for <20 
damage with Robo, he's no problem.  1 screen up to the right (not  up the 
ladder) is a weapon for Robo,  grab this and leave  the mountains and save  
your game again, now you can resume.

This area  is a minefield of forced  encounters, many are  on invisible 
trigger squares for which paths  to avoid them will be detailed here.  It's 
a long way to the next save point,  so my advice is not to rush  this next 
section, you do NOT want to be avoiding all these encounters over and over 
again. Really.

Now head through, running from every encounter, grab the Revive and 500 G.

When  you  meet the  Ogan  (with  the Wooden  Hammer)  that  jumps out  &  
back repetitively,  dodge him  and run  up  the ladder,  then the  next 
ladder  then there should be a turning to the right to reach the next screen.

On  this screen  there  are no  inescapable encounters,  grab  the Revive,  
Mid Ether, Gold Helm & Mid Tonic and head left onto your next screen.

This screen also has no inescapable  encounters, just a rock throwing monster 
& a chest with a Mid Ether, head up and right onto your next screen.

Now,  walking,  hug  the top  wall  until  you  meet  the ladder  to  avoid  
an inescapable  encounter with  a Free  Lancer  & Ogan.  Head up  the ladder  
and, still walking, hug the  right wall, grab the chest with 600 G,  hug the 
wall on your left down then up to the next path then head up into your next 
screen.

You  should  be on  a  cliff-edge  field, hug  the  outmost  edge, as  you  
can sometimes  hit   an  inescapable  encounter   here.  Thanks   
CyberSarkany  for identifying this.

Here you  should be  near a waterfall,  here fall down  the left  waterfall 
and grab the Silver Stud  & Silver Erng, 2 of the best accessories in the 
game!

Head up to reach  the next screen, then up again to reach  the cliff again, 
hug the top side  as before and head left  onto the waterfall again.  Now 
head left past the Free Lancer to grab the chest.

Now  as you  go  down the  ladder,  hug the  left wall,  walking  to avoid  
the inescapable battle with 2 Free Lancers, and to get to your next screen.

Hug  the bottom  wall to  the bridge  to avoid  the inescapable  battle with  
3 Bellbirds,  once  on the  bridge  you  may  safely  talk  to the  White  
Monkey repetitively for a Magic Tab, head down to your next screen.

Head down and hold off  saving for just a second, grab the  chest and bash A 
in the very bottom  left of  the screen  for  your second  speed  tab this  
game, now  head through to the  next screen to grab the  Gold Suit, now come 
back  to the Save Point and equip your characters:

Robo : Gold Helm, Meso Mail, Speed Belt 
Crono: Next Best Helm, Gold Suit, Silver Erng 
Marle: Doesnâ€™t Matter

Now you have my permission to save.

This next screen  has a fairly tough to avoid  forced encounter, while 
touching the Hetakes  themselves are triggers, attempting  to climb the 
ladder  with the Freelancer above it  is too close will have  his knock you 
back  down into that said battle.  So  my advice is  to  completely ignore 
the  treasure  chest here (it's just  a Shelter)  and simply run  as fast  as 
you can  around and  up the ladder. There is a  good chance that the 
Freelancer will be  far away enough to run over  to  the other side  when  
you climb the  ladder,  effectively avoiding that forced  encounter. I'm  sure 
there is  a more precise  method to  this but this blunt  approach seems  to 
work  around 30%  of the  time, which  is plenty enough!

A/N: Thanks to CyberSarkany for reminding me of the Gold Suit

Fortunately  for  you,  that's  the  end of  your  encounter-dodging  for  
this section, and now you will face Masa & Mune, best of luck!

**********
Masa
Mune
400 Exp

**********

Very  straightforward, just  attack  the one  with the  purple  collar, on  
the left, you shouldnâ€™t need  to heal, if you need Crono and Marle  to die 
just have them attack  the other one to  be K.O'd by  their counter attack 
so  that only Robo absorbs this.

Now for the big boss..

**********
Masa & Mune (fused)
500 Exp
3500 Hp
**********

Masa & Muneâ€™s initial attack pattern is

Attack (33 - 36 Damage) Attack (33 - 36 Damage) Wind (65 - 70 Damage) Store 
Tornado Energy (with slash counterattack) Tornado (165 Damage) Repeat

Crono should  be able to survive  all of his  attacks in this stage,  just 
have him heal  himself  and Robo with  Tonics,  and when he  begins  storing 
tornado energy, have Crono use  his Slash to negate it and  restart the 
attack pattern. This should help  you conserve resources and so  a good chunk 
of  his HP before he changes his attack pattern..

Attack (70 - 76 Damage) Attack (70 - 76 Damage) Store Tornado Energy Tornado 
(165 Damage)

You don't  get any warning  when he changes his  attack pattern, but  is 
easily judges  in the  doubling  in his  attack  power, now  Crono  can't 
survive  for anything, so just let  him die, Robo will take things alone  
from here. Use the following move pattern:

Tornado (Robo has 100 Hp left) Robo immediately Rocket punch Masa & Mune 
Attacks Robo uses Mid Tonic Masa & Mune attacks Again Robo uses Rocket punch 
Masa & Mune stores energy Robo uses Cure Beams to heal Repeat.

Use a  Mid Ether when needed, adhering  to this protocol  strictly simply 
makes this a case  of how many Mid Tonics  can you save. Masa &  Mune will 
eventually fall and Robo will absorb all 500 Exp.

Now do not heal  any of your characters except Robo, which  you'll want to 
heal to max and  also make sure he has at  least 6 MP so he can  cast 2 laser 
spins. Use an Ether if needed.

Continue with the  necessary storyline and eventually you'll need  to go to 
65M BC for  your dreamstone.  But wait! If  you remember, you  will lose  
your gate key here  with no way  to get back  to the previous  eras to 
purchase  what you need. So first you must make sure your inventory is 
stocked up like so:

Crono, Marle & Robo in party 20 Revives 20 Mid Tonics

Sell your  old equipment to  make ends meet  if you must  (the Lode Bows  are 
a good place to begin), just make sure you have these.

Now we must  take a little  detour, all the way forth  to 2300 AD.  This is 
one of the  main updates  for this  FAQ and this  is one  of the  few 
opportunities that the EXP  mechanics allow for this following sequence.  
Head to the Sewers, you want  to grab the Rage  Band just before  Sir 
Crawlie, but before  that you must  fight a  forced encounter  near  the 
entrance  to the  sewers. Have  Robo Marle and Crono in your party.

Robo  can absorb  this, this  experience is  virtually all  written off  
later, don't worry about it at all as it will not affect the party levels.

Now  avoid  the forced  encounters  by  refraining  from touching  the  
'sound' triggers (cheese,  the can & trash  can and the  save point) and 
grab  the Rage Band  just before Sir  Crawlie.  Go no further  and  come 
back. Time  to  go to 65000000 BC.

65000000 BC - Reptite Lair
***********

You fall straight into a forced battle.

**********
Reptite x5
360 Exp
**********

Yep,  Chrono and Marle  bite  the dust and  Robo  uses a single  laser  spin 
to finish this off,  and now with albeit some  help from Ayla, you  face your 
next forced encounter.

**********
Reptite x 4
288 Exp
**********

Same drill as before.

After the following  scenes including meeting Ayla & the  party you should 
have your precious gate  Key stolen, now for your  party of Crono Marle  and 
Ayla to begin the  forest maze. None  of the encounters  here are 
inescapable,  so make sure you  sack this place  for everything, there  are 
plenty of  resources here to find. Now  make sure Ayla's health is full  and 
Crono and Marle are  at 1 Hp to make  the following forced encounters  
easier. Save outside  before entering the Reptite Lair.

After entering  the Reptite Lair,  before long youâ€™ll enter  a room with  a 
few Evilweevils which  you  can't escape from  if  you encounter them,  wait  
a few seconds and each Evilweevil  will  dig  a hole,  you  must  use  one  
of these  holes  to  reach downstairs,  each  hole  forces  you  into   a  
different  set  of  inescapable encounters.

You should see 5 Holes spaced like this after a few seconds.

###1######
##########
2#########
####4#####
#########5
##3#######

There will be  some randomness to the  positioning, and if you  should meet 
the wrong set of monsters, try again

Hole 1 gives you
Evilweevil x2 - 162 Exp and Megasaur x1 (830 Hp) - 147 Exp

No treasure - 309 Exp total

Hole 2 gives you
Evilweevil x2 - 162 Exp and Megasaur x1 (830 Hp) - 147 Exp

No treasure - 309 Exp total

Hole 3 gives you
Fly Trap + Evilweevil - 167 Exp and Fly Trap + Evilweevil - 167 Exp 

There is a Mid Ether & Mid Tonic in the chests, total of 334 Exp.

Hole 4 gives you
Evilweevil x2 - 162 Exp and Megasaur x1 (830 Hp) - 147 Exp

No treasure - 309 Exp total

Hole 5 gives you
Evilweevil x2 - 162 Exp and Fly Trap + Evilweevil x2 - 248 Exp 

There is a Ruby Vest in the chest, total of 410 Exp.

Just take any of hole  1,2 or 4... The treasures are not worth  the Exp for 3 
& 5.

In  the next room  there  are tonnes of  Reptites  and also 2  chests  behind 
2 repites,  one  with  a  Rock  Helm  and the  other  with  a  Full  Ether  
(both behind  a  Reptite), it  can  be  pretty  tough  getting these  chests  
without triggering  an encounter,  so  you may  want  to skip  these  if 
you're  having trouble. The previous  save point is not  far behind so I'll  
leave that choice to you, but the Full Ether does sell for very handsome G.

Run from  the next  few encounters,  save & use  a shelter  at the  save 
point. Now equip Crono with the Rock Helm,  Meso Mail and Silver Stud, equip 
Ayla with the Bandana and the  worst armours you have, after this  battle 
Ayla will leave (for quite a while) taking what you equipped on her with her.
 
As you enter  the next room youâ€™ll face  Nizbel. You will need  to keep 
precise track of  his Hp.  I'd recommend a  jot pad, a calculator  and 
massive  abuse of the pause button.

**********
Nizbel
500 Exp
4200 Hp
**********

Basically  fight  him  how  you  would   in  a  normal  game,  except  Nizbelâ€™
 s electrocution attack  will kill Crono and  hurt Ayla. Have Crono  use 
Lightning and have Ayla attack non-stop, have Crono heal  Ayla so she has at 
least 200 Hp before  Nizbelâ€™s  electrocution  attack (Tonics/Mid  Tonics).  
You'll  need  to revive Crono  every time the electrocute  attack kills  him 
and have  Crono cast lightning ASAP.  With the  Rock Helm  & Meso Mail  Crono 
should  easily survive the Earthquake, although  the normal attack will kill 
Crono  - revive him again if this happens 

Now, hopefully you  have been keeping careful track of  his Hp (definitely 
abuse pause to give yourself  time to keep track of Hp), use  Crono's attack 
to bring Nizbel's atk down to  a reasonably low level (>50 Hp is  great), now 
have Crono killed off  by electrocute and Ayla finish  off with her  normal 
attacks, which will deal  negligible damage  without reviving  Crono. Time  
this well  as it's easy to waste excessive resources with this.

Now that  you are finished  with this section,  after the following  scenes 
you must prepare for Magus's  castle. You can grab the Taban Helm  while you 
are at it, but make sure you have at least the following:

80 Mid Tonics
20 Revives
15 Heals

If you have G  to spare, max out on Mid-Tonics 1st  before buying more 
revives. Trust me you're going  to need them. And if you can't make  the ends 
meet, then sell your old equipment, starting with your old weapons.

600 AD - Magusâ€™s Castle
***********
Pick Frog  up and have  him learn his  magic and Marle  and Frog learn  the 
Ice Water dual tech  from Spekkio. Heal your team  too. Now go to  Magus's 
Lair and save, the castle was probably tough in your LLG, it's no less down

After the  following storyline  and stepping  on the  false save  point, 
you'll find your first forced encounter.

You should know what to do, Crono &  Marle dies & Frog lives. However make 
sure you take out a  few enemies before letting them die because  the 6

Frog), Slash does  little damage to  your characters (he  will however take  
out Crono in one hit), when  Crono and Marle dies do not bother  reviving 
them. When Frog exhausts his  MP use a Mid  Ether, you should have  a decent 
stock of  these (I had 20) which should  comfortably last you for the 
remainder  of the game. Keep Frog reasonably buffed with Hp and this first 
part should be simple.

A Fire  2 spell signals  the transition to  his 'equipped phase',  and 
spamming Slash (75  dmg to frog)  at your party. again  don't bother 
reviving  Crono and Marle  and attack  and healing  with  Mid-Tonics as  
necessary. Frog  shouldn't have a problem keeping  up with Slash 1 on 1  
whilst dealing respectable damage himself. After  about 8  hits watch  Slash 
carefully,  heâ€™s about  to transition into  his  3rd,  much  more  deadly  
phase. You  can  tell  when  he  has  just transitioned  when his  body 
movements  become  very erratic  (jumpy). When  he does  this,  immediately 
heal  with  Mid  Tonics.  This  is where  the  fight's difficulty increases 
tenfold.

In Slashâ€™s 3rd phase Slash will use Leap Slash (120-135 Damage), 'Yes 
Indeed!' attack (100-110 Damage), Regular Attack (60-70 Damage) Slash (75 
Damage) 

On top  of that,  Slash's speed has  almost doubled, and  is likely  to 
double- turn  Frog on  occasion.  Fortunately his  attacks follow  a  set 
specific  and predictable pattern:

Leap Slash
Leap Slash
'Yes Indeed!' Attack
Slash
Leap Slash
Normal Attack
Slash
Normal Attack

There is a  relatively long time delay between the  2 consecutive leap 
slashes, and the end  of the pattern with the Normal->Slash->Normal  is where 
the damage mounts up  slowest. Remember  this as  these are your  2 best  
opportunities to attack.

So as before concentrate on keeping  Frog healed with Mid-Tonics, and only 
Mid- Tonics as  the damage  racks up  just far  too quickly.  Now after  the 
Normal- >Slash->Normal  combo ensure  Frog  is at  full health.  After  the 
first  Leap Slash,  immediately Slurp  Cut  Slash, and  Frog  will be  fast  
enough to  get another turn in to  heal before the next Leap Slash.  
Furthermore after the 3rd Leap Slash you should be able to safely get another 
Slurp Cut in.

You will  need to  stay on the  ball in  this fight right  till the  very 
end, Slash does  have a fourth  phase which begins when  Slash is at  critical 
health (~<800), which  is  exactly the same  as  the third except  he  
counter attacks every  attack with  'Yes  Indeed!'.  Damage will  most  
certainly  rack up  too quickly to safely  attempt attacking between the 2 
Leap  Slashes, so limit your attacks  to  just the  Normal->Slash->Normal  
combo  and  you should  be,  just about, fine.

After  you win  you gain  probably  the most  useful  weapon in  the game,  
the Slasher!  A brilliant  weapon  that  gives  Crono a  +2  speed bonus  
for  zip, coupled with a Speed  Belt and you have a ** Speed  capable 
Character. Not bad, at  all. The  Slasher also  has  decent attack  strength 
although  it pales  in comparison to the Frog & Ayla.

Now head  down the right  corridor and talk to  the children around  the 
chest, run from this encounter  and you must collect the Barrier  from the 
chest. Your success on this challenge depends on you not forgetting this item! 

Carry on  down the right  corridor and before  you talk  to â€˜Fleaâ€™ set  up 
your characters as follows:

Crono: Berserker
Frog : Ruby Vest, Rock Helm, Speed belt 
Marle: Magic Scarf

And optimize the rest of the equipment on Marle first then Crono.

**********
â€˜Fleaâ€™
0 exp
**********

Crono attacks & gets Mp Busted (donâ€™t  worry about having Marle or Crono KOâ€˜ 
d), now the real flea appears.

**********
Flea
500 Exp
4100 Hp
**********

Flea is  REALLY  weak compared to  the  other bosses you  have  encounters.. 
he doesnâ€™t do over 60 damage so my advice  is just Slurp Cut & Mid-Tonic 
away, use a  heal when  blinded/poisoned and  a Mid  Ether  when out  of MP.  
On Crono  & Marle's part,  Crono attacks  till he dies  & Marle Iceâ€™s  till 
she  dies. Frog faces  off  against  Flea  alone  eventually.. And  
eventually  he  will  fall, leaving Frog to collect the 500 exp (and a level).

Collect the Magic  Tab thatâ€™s dropped and head  back out of the  lair. Save 
and heal outside before  progressing further. You also need to  check your 
itinery, you most likely  used about 40 Mid-Tonics about  now, you need at  
least 50 for the next section, go back and purchase some more if you need to.

Run through  and run from every encounter.  Grab the Mist  Robe and, 
critically the Dark  Mail. The  next room  contains lots of  monsters.. All  
avoidable but inescapable.  The only  â€˜triggersâ€™  in  this  room are  being  
hit by  a  Green Rollie, just use the ladders to avoid these head through 
onto the next room.

Now you enter a room.. Where Ozzie will  drop you through the floor if you 
step wrong. Now  dropping down  the said  holes does  indeed drop  is into  a 
forced encounter, but this  is a necessary evil, as  the room we are dropped  
in has a critical second barrier  that we will need in order  to defeat 
Magus. According to mathematic  however, this doesnâ€™t affect our  final 
levels, do  not worry. So without further ado:

**********
Decendant x6
72 exp
**********

Crono & Marle dies - Frog lives and absorbs the 72 exp.

Ransack this room,  and try and find the  save point at least once  and save 
in this room  (there's a Tab  here too along  with the  barrier), you have  a 
very very  tough  couple rooms  ahead  of  you  in  terms  of dodging  and  
surviving encounters. When you are  at the save point, do not heal  anyone, 
and only heal Frog with  Tonics, we need  the other 2  to die  quickly. The 
battle  with the 'save points' is escapable, don't worry.

After you have  done all that head up and  around to Ozzie then up  to the 
next room. In  this room  are loads  of inescapable  but avoidable  
encounters.. And will take several tries  on a SNES. In fact, I recommend  
you fight the battles in your  first few attempts and  just try and get  a 
feel for this  room, enter and exit  it  and keep trying  and  trying, 
fighting and  winning  the battles, once you  are  comfortable enough 
dodging  these  in a single  run,  reset your game and try for real.

There are 2 triggers

Touching (or nearly touching) an Outlaw Touching a Grey Rollie.

I will guide  you through the Outlaws 1  at a time, for the  Rollies just 
avoid them by 1. Going to the â€˜cornersâ€™ at the end of the stairs

Like this

This is a 2d diagram looking at the side, stand at 1 and you should be fine.

Now for  the first Outlaw,  this outlaw is moving  towards you, so  run 
towards him hugging  (hold Up & Left  buttons) the top wall,  as soon as you  
reach the stairs  release the left  button  and run up  (effectively  â€˜
squeezingâ€™ between the Outlaw & Stairs)

A Rollie should be  coming down the stairs so go into the  upper left corner 
of this  box you dodged  the  outlaw in and  wait  for the Rollie  to  pass 
before continuing  up (the  outlaw  can  follow you  once  you  pass him  
horizontally, strangely enough).

Hereâ€™s a diagram


F~~~~~~~~~
#########~
#######O#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   EEEEEE
                 ########~~~~~~~~~~
                 ##################

EEEEEE = Entrance
0 = Outlaw 
~ = Route to take.
F = Finish point (to wait for Rollie to pass).

The next Outlaw is the  save as the first, hug the top  edge but when you 
reach the  end of  the stairs  release  the right  button  and you  squeeze 
past  the outlaw  similarly  to  how  you  did  the  first  one.  Do  that  
youâ€™ll  avoid the 2nd Outlaw.

The Third Outlaw is easier heâ€™s walking  towards you like the first was but 
not we have ladders  underneath the bit he walks across,  although the Outlaw 
might seem to  be following Crono,  he is actually following  the 3rd person  
in your party  (Marle)   as  sheâ€™s  following   Frog  whoâ€™s  Following  
Crono   in  the standard â€˜walking trioâ€™.

Now we  can abuse this, walk  into the ladder with  Crono then walk up  off 
the ladder but  stand just  above it. The  Outlaw will inch  his way  towards 
Crono (go  back  onto the  ladder  when  a Rollie  goes  past).  When the  
Outlaw  is uncomfortable close have  Crono walk to the  right, so far as  
that Marle whoâ€™ s at the back of the  Trio will also walk off the ladder.  
Walk to the right just far enough  so Marle  is the  only person on  the 
ladder,  now the  Outlaw will walk onto  the ladder and  down it to  follow 
Marle.. You  can now safely   by- pass the Outlaw.

############O##F##C#####
              M
O = Outlaw
F = frog
C = Crono
M = Marle.

The 4th and  final Outlaw is the easiest  to bypass, just hold UP  to climb 
the stairs and youâ€™ll walk right past him, you donâ€™t even have to run.

After that give yourself a pat on the back.

In the  next room are  2 inescapable encounters.  Do *not* take any  risks in 
these  fights, you  definitely don't  want to  be repeating  the previous  
room over and over.

Have everyone attack the  Groupies and kill them first, then  let Crono & 
Marle die.  Use Mid  Tonics  if necessary..  If  you  conserve you  run  the 
risk  of dying..  Have Frog finish the Outlaws alone & will grow to level 13.

The second  set of  monsters you can  actually escape from,  some good  news 
at last!

For the next battle give Frog the Ruby Vest and Silver Stud.

**********
Juggler x4
512 Exp
**********

Crono &  Marle uses Magic  on the Jugglers,  Frog uses  Slurp Cut on  the oneâ€™
 s whoâ€™s defence mode  is MAGIC (from Crono  & Marleâ€™s magic). Crono  & Marle 
will eventually get KOâ€™d, in which case have  Frog to the Magicing & 
Attacking. Frog will absorb all  the exp. The Ruby Vest  halves the damage 
you  take form their Fire attack, making them much more manageable. Frog 
absorbs all 512 exp.

Head up  & grab a second  Speed Belt, head up  & run from every  encounter, 
now you face Ozzie. 

**********
Ozzie
0 Exp

Attack  the chains  as normal..  donâ€™t worry  this battle  gives no  exp so  
no worries about Crono & Marle not being killed off.

Grab a 2nd Mist Robe  & a 3rd Magicscarf in this room,  SAVE and use a 
Shelter. Now you must face Magus, first however you  must know a bit about 
him to defeat him.

**********
Magus
1500 Exp
6666 Hp
**********

Set Up your Characters:

Crono: Slasher, Meso Mail, Speed Belt 
Frog : Masamune, Rock Helm, Dark Mail, Speed Belt 
Marle: Mist Robe, Magic Scarf

Optimize the remaining helmets on Crono 1st then Marle

Frog does not  need the SilverErng because it makes  no difference, Dark 
Matter is survivable with Barrier  & 230 Hp and the Speed Belt  really is 
necessary to get moves off fast enough.

Magus  is probably  the  most  technically  challenging boss  in  a LLG,  by  
a country mile.  He combines the need  for accurate timing, abundant  healing 
and some luck.

Magusâ€™s Attack Patterns: Magus actually only has 2 attack patterns..

First phase >4500 Hp
Alternates between these 2 attacks Geyser / Hp Down, 35-40 damage & Hp Down 
Status Normal Attack, 65-70 Damage

And Magus will  counter every magical attack or every  2nd physical attack 
with one of these spells, and also change his weakness to it.

Shadow (150-160 Damage to Frog) 
Lightning 2 (110-120 Damage to Frog) 
Ice 2 ( 90-95 Damage to Frog) 
Fire 2 (110-120 Damage to Frog)

Frog  should, hopefully,  survive any  2 attacks  from full  health, except  
an unlucky Shadow  Counter & Normal attack  combo. Just pray that  doesn't 
happen. Now the  only magical damage  you're really going  to be  able to 
deal  here is with Frog's  Water spell which  after 1 normal  attack from 
Frog's  Masamune to lower Magus's defence,  will deal 240. You're  going to 
need some  luck here in order  not to  exhaust  yourself of  Mid  Tonics, 
hopefully  up  have an  ample supply at  this point. But  before I speak 
more  about strategy in  this phase, you should be aware of his last phase.

Second phase <4500 Hp
Magus risks casting a spell (1-2 damage to all) 
Dark Matter (305 damage to Frog)

In case you haven't yet  done the math, 305 Hp is more  Frog has at maximum 
Hp, even with  the SilverErng  equipped. He's  already maximally  set up  for 
magic defence. But,  we have those 2  barriers! Ah yes  2 items that will  
grace Frog with the ability  to nullify 1/3 of the  magical damage he 
receives  for all of 60 battle  seconds. 2 minutes, that's all  Frog's got 
to  survive the necessary Dark Matters in order to finish off that remaining 
4500 Hp.

So in order to get past this battle have with you a few things.

Pen & Paper
Calculator
Your fastest fingers
Your battle speed set to 1

The  last point  is probably  the  most important  one, as  raising the  
battle speed  will  allow  more  turns  to  be   performed  in  a  certain  
amount  of battle time, it  also means  you get a  bigger window for  the 
Barrier  to last, you need one barrier  to protect you from 3 Dark Matters  
at this battle speed, and you'll  need to time  the use of  the barrier  very 
precisely to  make this happen on  the  faster speeds. But  this  also, of 
course  makes  the necessary micromanagement that much tougher too.

So for  a start to finish  battle strategy, allow  Marle and Crono to  die 
off, they're completely  useless at the beginning,  and attack Magus to  
trigger his barrier change, if  he changes to Water,  good job, attack Magus  
once to lower his defence  with Frog and  then cast water, if  he changes to  
something else, you will  need to attack him  twice in order  for his barrier 
to  chance again. All the  while with keeping  track of his  Hp, and  of 
course keeping  track of your own Hp,  Frog isn't going to  last very long 
without  healing, you'll have to  play very  defensively keeping  on  top of  
healing with  Mid Tonics.  Don't bother using anything less, you'll only 
waste time for yourself later.

Now most importantly, once  Magus is one Magic hit away from  going to his 
next phase, after  attacking Magus once,  revive Crono and  Marle. You need  
all the turns you can  get while Magus is in  his second, lethal phase.  Have 
Crono and Marle heal Frog  to his maximum Hp and  Mp and remove his Hp  Down 
status, also you need  to have hit Magus,  to lower his  Magic defence, of 
course.  You will probably need  to revive  your characters  a few times  to 
accomplish  this but it's necessary, now  is probably a good time  to use 
that Lapis.  Once you have Frog at  Full HP with  his status cured,  and 
Crono  and Marle alive,  with all their turns available, you are all set.

Cast the  dual tech Ice Water  to hit him hard  into his second phase,  now 
you must act quickly.  Have Crono attack Magus,  Marle cast Ice and  Frog use 
Slurp Cut repeatedly.  Do not even  bother trying to use  his normal attack,  
time is too far against us.  Before Magus's 1st Darkmatter have Crono  use a 
barrier on Frog.  Crono is  your fastest  character and  his turns  the most  
dispensable. Dark Matter  will do  barely over 200,  healable with a  single 
Mid  Tonic. But Frog simply doesn't have  time for this. Have Frog revive  
Crono with his first available  turn, and  relentlessly attack  with Slurp  
Cut. Use  Crono to  heal Frog  and then  attack  Magus  too.  These small  
attacks  of Cronoâ€™s  may  seem insignificant,  but they make  all  that much 
difference.  Repeat  this process after every  Dark Matter, reviving  Crono 
and  attacking with Frog.  Crono will need to use  a second Barrier on Frog  
after Magus has used  three Dark Matters (It  can  actually sometimes  last  
4  Dark  Matters),  wait for  the  existing barrier to  wear out  before 
using  the next, keep  a close  eye on  Frog. Also Crono will need to heal 
Frog's MP with a Mid Ether

After Magus's fifth  Dark Matter do not  revive Crono, as you  should have 
done enough damage  to  finish things with  Frog  alone, have him  heal  
himself and assault, you should have enough time to get in the remaining 
damage.

If you  are really, really  struggling to make the  damage count, you  can 
give Frog some Power Tabs to help make ends meet.

*Thanks Moogleboss for suggesting and testing the idea

Once  you win,  congrats, you  just  beat one  of  the hardest  bosses in

Frog  will absorb  an obscene  quantity  of exp  and  we will  be propelled

**>-14-<***
65000000 BC - Tyrano Lair
***********

You  awaken in  65000000 BC,  proceed through  the following  scenes until  
you attain the  Dactyl, now donâ€™t go  to the Tyrano  Lair just yet. First  
thing of course is to save but to head back to 600 AD, we need supplies.

You need:
50 Mid Tonics
20 Revives
5 Ethers and Mid Ethers

Head into  Tyrano Lair, there are  no unavoidable inescapable  encounters 
here, however  avoiding these,  especially  on  a  SNES will  be  a doozey,  
it's  as tedious  as the room in  Magus'  lair and  as  tricky 
as  Denadoro Mountains! But  fortunately this is the  last of the encounter-
dodging  we need to do.

When youâ€™re in  the Tyrano lair take  the right passage, run  from everything 
and release Kino. Follow Kino up & around and into the left skull.

Step  on both  switches &  head  through the  left  passage, hug  the top  
wall outside, the  Reptites are easy  to avoid (just donâ€™t  touch them) and  
up into the next room. This room will consist of lots of teleporters. Hug the 
left wall  & move up until you reach a one  square long â€˜bridgeâ€™. Cross it  
and then  hug  the  wall to  your  right &  go  straight  up. Donâ€™t  bother 
collecting the  egg on  the top wall,  hug the  top wall to  the stairs  and 
go down.

This next  balcony is very  tough, huge the top  wall tightly and  youâ€™ll 
avoid the random encounters here,  stop hutting the top wall when  you reach 
the door thatâ€™s sealed.  There is  a path  approximately â€˜one  squareâ€™ above  
the bottom wall which  is about â€˜one square  thickâ€™ then you  can take which 
allow  you to evade the random encounters.

Diagram of the balcony:

S = Starting position on screen P= Path to take XXXX = Grated door TTTT = 
Target door
G = Running Point (read on..)

Inside the next room is no save point,  press the right switch only and head 
up and flick the  switch in there, head out  and follow the path you  took. 
Now if you are  on an emulator,  save state, if  on a  SNES, go outside  
Tyrano's Lair and Save.

Now go to  point G, line yourself so that  just under half of Crono  is in 
line of the  front of  the pillar and  half is  in front of  the opening.  
Now start with Crono facing  the door, hold B and  dash towards it, as you  
each the door Crono should  â€˜bump offâ€™  the corner  of the  pillar and  enter 
the  next room. This door  is programmed  to be  a forced  encounter by  any 
normal  means, but running at  the door  this way  triggers the screen  
transition at  exactly the same  time as  the battle  (you will  see your  
characters run  back to  enter battle  stance  as the  screen  fades  out).  
This  will probably  take  several attempts,  but it  is  definitely 
entirely  possible  without killing  yourself over it, I  have run at the 
door form  the same save state at the  same time in the same way and  gotten 
different results, so there is a  large degree of luck involved in this. May  
you only have the best of it! I  have even completed this section  on   the  
iPhone   version  of  Crono   Trigger,  where   movement  is substantially 
more  laborious and  less responsive, so  I'm sure  it's possible for anyone 
to achieve even on a SNES!

Now save in this room and prepare yourself for...

**********
Nizbel II
880 Exp
6500 Hp
**********

To  those of  you  who  defeated  Nizbel II  with  the original  guide,  
please forgive me.  What used to be  one of the toughest,  and by a country  
mile, the most  annoying is  all  but  trivialized  by the  Rage  Band. The  
strategy  is simple, just have the following checklist prepared:

Ayla: Fist, Rock Helm, Mist Robe, Rage Band, full 40 MP 
Crono: Slasher, Speed Belt 
Battle Speed: Fastest

All you must  do is have Chrono cast  2 Lightings on Nizbel,  which will 
bring his  defence to  its minimum,  cast  no more  than  that as  that will  
trigger Nizbel's painful  lightning counter. You should have  ample time to  
do this at the  start as  you have  2 other  party members  to distract  fire 
from  Crono, reset if you fail first time.

After  that  it  simply  becomes  a   waiting  game,  have  Ayla  heal  
herself constantly  with  Kisses,  and  she  will randomly  counterattack  
50%  of  the attacks coming her  way for 225 damage, 440  if a critical hit.  
Have Marle and Crono  do nothing  but  the  2 aforementioned  lightings,  
they  will die  off quickly enough, and remain dead.

Now,  because  you  are  damaging  via counter  attacks  instead  of  
directly, Nizbel's  (ANNOYING) defence  boosting counter  doesn't come  into 
effect,  and thus so long  as you never directly attack  him, it will remain  
at its lowest throughout the fight!

~25 Counterattacks later and the former pain in the ass will fall, good job!

Don't  forget to  save, this  next  section is  very, very  tricky to  
navigate without triggering any  forced encounters. Now continue on through  
to the next room, which  is the balcony  depicted in the diagram  below, make 
sure  you are walking, and not running through this section.

Hug the bottom  ledge until you are  exactly halfway between the  entry 
and central door  (you can  use the  5 bricks as  a marker  too, and  go up  
on the third  one) before  going up  and hugging  the top  ledge until  you 
reach  the middle of  the big  balcony. You  can safely move  to the  bottom 
of  the ledge without triggering anything Now on  the next part  hug the 
BOTTOM  edge of the  balcony until youâ€™re  in line with the right  half of the 
right pillar  door, then you can safely  go upwards & inside the room.

Again, as  depicted with  Magus's lair and  balcony before Nizbel  II, if  on 
a SNES it is  definitely a good idea to  just practice this section  a few 
times, fighting the  battles and gaining  the levels, just  to feel exactly  
where the trigger spots  are if you  keep tripping them, then  reset and try  
the balcony for real,  the previous save point is very  close in comparison  
to the previous section.

Once you  enter the  room step  on the  top-most switch,  before you  save 
make sure  your  party  is  fully  healed  and  you  have  them  equipped  
like  so: 
Crono: Slasher, Speed Belt 
Ayla: Ruby Vest, Speed Belt 
Marle: Silver Stud

And prioritize your  remaining armours to Ayla  1st, Marle 2nd &  Crono 3rd, 
now you can  trip the  left switch  and save, we  have 1  more tricky  
encounter to dodge now.

Retrace your steps to  the Middle Door (previously grated), all  but one of 
the tiles  in  a line  towards  the  doorway  trigger  a  forced encounter  
with  a gigasaur, there  is a  *very* narrow path  on the right  hand side  
that avoids this and  will let you  through to the next  room without any  
unnecessary exp. Align Crono  so the left  half of his  body is in  line with 
the  right pillar, and the right half  is in line with, of course, the wall.  
Walk through and you should avoid the  encounter. This will likely require 
some  trial and error and several resets, but the window is most definitely 
there.

Now you must fight  Azala, if you required a large number  of attempts to 
avoid those forced  encounters,  you definitely do  not  want to be  taking  
too many risks in this right, but it's generally quite straightforward.

**********

Azala's Moves:
Rock Teleport: Almost kills, or barely kills Marle 
Sleep: Can cure with Kiss/Heal 
Telekenesis: ~70 Damage

Tyrano's Moves:
Single Target Flame: ~20 Damage to Ayla, 50 to Marle 
Countdown: Hp Down Status 
Chew: Absorbs 200 Hp from Ayla, 50 from Marle 
Charged Flame Attack: ~160 to Ayla, kills Marle

Don't  be intimidated  in the  least  by their  moveset however,  as they  
make their moves are generally very slow.

For the first  half of the fight you  want to concentrate on  Azala, have 
Crono use Lightning on Azala (and he will die shortly)  Ayla heals Marle & 
Herself with  Kisses/Mid Tonics and Marle concentrates on using  Ice on  
Azala for  85 damage a  hit. Use  a Mid  Ether on  Marle when necessary.

Just make  sure you always  have Aylaâ€™s turn available  to heal and  you 
should be perfectly fine,  you should only need to  revive Marle 4-5 times  
if you are careful. When Tyranoâ€™s  Countdown is   over make sure Ayla  has 
full health  and sheâ€™ll survive no problem (Tyrano's attack does 150 
damage), revive Marle after and continue.  The only thing to worry about is  
having Ayla put to sleep immediately  after Tyrano's countdown, but  this 
should not be  a problem if you heal with reasonable liberality. Don't take 
any  more risks then you have  to, you don't want  to keep repeating that 
forced encounter dodge earlier.

When Azala falls heâ€™ll  use Break, Hp Down. Now you face  Black Tyrano, and 
all of 10500  Hp, but do not  worry, Tyrano is so  slow with its actions  
that Ayla is always  fast enough to  get at least  1 turn in  before Tyrano 
follows  up a previous move.  Use a Mid Tonic immediately  after each 
Charged  Flame and Bite attack  and Ayla  is  in absolutely  no  damage  of 
dying,  just  hack your  way through each  and every  one of  those 10500  
Hp's with  Ayla's attacks  and he will fall, leaving Ayla with 1800 juicy Exp.

Ayla will  absorb all  1800 Exp,  after the following  scenes youâ€™ll  arrive 
in 12000 BC.

Congratulations! You have achieved your party's final levels!

Crono: Level 1
Next Level 14 Exp.

Marle: Level 4
Next Level 4 Exp.

Lucca: Level 15
Next Level 1450 Exp.

Frog : Level 15
Next Level 100 Exp.

Robo : Level 16
Next Level 290 Exp.

Ayla : Level 20
Next Level 581 Exp.

However  this is  not -quite-  the end  of your  encounter-dodging antics,  
and also we have yet to collect Magus

**>-15-<***
12000 BC - The Wallet
**********

Head through the gate and youâ€™ll reach 12000 BC. Go through this  place till 
you reach Zeal  Palace (donâ€™t do the  Fire, Water & Wind books just yet..  Weâ€™
ll come back to these shortly  enough). Tell the lady in the Castle  with the 
plant  for her to plant it,  not burn it.  This opens a very important side-
quest to  us later on. Scratch the Nuâ€™s  back on the bridge now head back  to 
Kajar, enter the top-right  room & scratch the  Nu in thereâ€™ s back for  a 
Magic tab. More importantly  however you can  search the right- side of the 
bottom wall in the very same room for a Speed tab!

Now  head back  to Zeal  palace and  charge your  pendant after  a few  
scenes. Great! This  now grants you access to  tonnes of really  useful items 
including the Wallet!  However two Nuâ€™s block  your path so  you must head 
into  the room above and experience the scenes there.

Sadly it's  impossible to  absorb the  1000 exp this  next fight  yields 
without level gain.  It is optional  however and losing  will still continue  
the game. But that's not to stop you beating him up for fun no less!

**********
Golem
7000 Hp
**********

Crono: Slasher, Speed Belt 
Marle: Speed Belt 
Ayla : Ceratopper, Mist Robe, Beserker

This has  got to  be one of  the most  ironic switches of  tactics I  have 
ever made,  as the  most well-accepted  strategies  for defeating  the 
Golems  avoid allowing the Golems  to Copy Physics, due to its  powerful 
physical attack that will wipe  out any  character in a  single hit. But,  
it's exactly  that, Golem can only attack  a single character at a  time in 
this form,  and he alternates between this and Iron  orb, which deals 50% of 
a  target's current health. With this in hand, the strategy to defeat the 
Golem becomes ridiculously simple!

1. Have your Berserked Ayla your sole source of damage 2. Only  use Crono  
and Marle's turns  to use a  revive fallen  characters from Golem's physical 
attacks 3. If Ayla  is killed/hit with Iron Orb,  ensure you use a Mid-Tonic  
on her to make sure she survives Golem's final attack (which does 150 damage 
to Ayla)

That's really all there  is to it, Crono and Marle can  easily move fast 
enough to revive and  heal faster than the Physical Attack  strikes, it 
simply becomes a case of waiting for Ayla to automatically hack through 
Golem's 7000 Hp.

Sadly,  we simply  cannot afford  to absorb  this exp  the fight,  so you  
must replay and lose this fight on purpose when you do win.

Afterwards you  will be booted back  to 65000000 BC,  and now with access  to 
a plethora  of awesome equipments  courtesy  of the Pendant!  Ransack  the 
Chrono Trigger  world  for what  it's  worth,  the  relevant treasures  
available  are listed below:

2300 AD:

Arris Dome -
Hit Ring
Gold Erng (!)
Lumin Robe
Elixir
Power Tab

Banjor Dome -
Charm top
Full Ether
Wallet (!!)

Give the Wallet to Crono for now.

Trann Dome -
Magic Tab
Full Ether
Gold Stud (!)

1000 AD:
Guardia & Truce - Red, Blue, Black and White Mails 
Heckran's Cave - Dash Ring 

Medina  Village -  By default  you  would choose  the  Safe Helm,  and all  
the strategies discusses later are  built with this in hand. But  if you are 
trying a minimum-tabs  run you will  need the Swallow, for  the Speed Bonus  
vs Lavos. You *should* be able  to work the existing strategies by  swapping 
the safe helm for the  next best  thing, and  then using  a shield  except 
the  Lavos Spawns. Expect an  update in  the next version  covering those 
with  the Swallow,  as I have yet to play-test them.

600 AD:
Guardia & Truce - Red, Blue, Black and White Vests 
Guardia Forest  - Speed Tab
	
The  coloured mails  & vests  are  along with  the Wallet  the most  
critically important items  to gather, to  get the coloured mails  you need 
to  touch each of the  chests in 600  AD at Guardia  Castle, Truce  Inn and 
Mayor's  Manor and decline  to remove  the items  inside. Then  you may  open 
the  same chests  in 1000AD for  the powered up  Items before getting  the 
originals in  600AD. Here now you have 2  copies of element absorbing armour 
for  each element, and these alone improve our survivability tenfold for our 
upcoming battles!

There are other items  besides the ones mentioned here, but  these are the 
only relevant ones to the challenge at hand.

Now we  are finally  free to  learn techs to  our hearts'  content! For  now 
we only need  Ayla's Charm ability,  form a party of  Crono, Robo and  Ayla, 
there are 2 good  places to gain the needed  tech points. One is in  the 
mountains in 65000000BC where the  gate is, the Runners and  Kilwalas there 
give 8  and 4 TP respectively per  fight.  Also there is  the  Nu in the  
hunting  grounds, which gives 30  TP a  pop. The first  option I  believe is 
a  little faster,  but the second  option gets  you all  the tradables  
conveniently, which  will be  our source of money for equipment later. 

A  recommended  equipment  setup  for  Nu  slaying  would  be  something  
like: 
Crono: Wallet 
Ayla: Berserker
Robo: Dash Ring

Only train  as far  as getting  Ayla charm,  there are  faster tech  sources 
of tech points available later.

And you  can upgrade your  weapons for Crono and  Robo quickly by  trading 
said items.

Now  if you  opted to  plant the  seed  in 12000  AD ,  we have  the option  
of completing the Sunken  Desert quest early! It's a very  tough challenge at 
this stage and without  the weapon upgrades, but definitely  possible and 
infinitely rewarding! If  you forgot to  plant the seed,  or just do  not 
want to  do this early then do not worry, we will come back to this later.

**>-16-<***
600AD - Sunken Desert
***********

You will need:
30 Mid Tonics
10 Revives
3-4 Lapis
1-2 Mid Ethers

This is  a critical  side quest to  completing the challenge  as it  yields 
the much-needed Green Dream  (more on that later). Form  a party of  Crono, 
Frog and Ayla, and equip them like so:

Completing quest before returning to 12000 AD: 
Crono: Aeon Blade, Elemental Mail, Wallet 
Frog: Masamune, Elemental Mail, Dash Ring 
Ayla: Safe Helm, Elemental Mail, Gold Erng

Completing quest after attaining Crono: 
Crono: Vedic Blade, Rainbow Helm, Ruby Armor, Wallet 
Frog: Bravesword, Safe Helm, Ruby Armor, Dash Ring 
Ayla: Rainbow Helm, Ruby Armor, Gold Erng

Proceed through as normal and heal your characters before Retinite.

**********
Retinite
Top - 5000 Hp
Core - 1000 Hp
Bottom - 4000 Hp
**********

This is another one  of those bosses where strategy guides  make me wince 
with their suggestions,  contraire to anything you may  have read before  DO 
NOT KILL THE CORE! If  you do then perhaps the  message it gives you  will 
indicate your mistake:

"Runs away without the core"

If the  core dies,  Retinite basically  goes insane  and splashes  attack 
after attack at  you which is  extremely difficult to manage  with even with  
all the equipments  from all  the side  quests, furthermore  you'll need  to 
use  water each and every time you attack. Do. Not. Kill. The. Core!

Now if you leave  the core alive, Retinite isnâ€™t so bad,  the fact it's 
actually 2 bosses  means the  attacks it does  so happen very  rapidly, for  
this reason designate Crono's  primary role as a healer,  using Lapis' Mid  
Tonics and Mid Ethers when needed,  and designate Frog the secondary healer.  
Crono will die a few times in  this fight, and sometimes  Frog too, revive 
them  at the earliest opportunity.

Now, the core  has 1000 Hp, and the top  and bottom absorb for just  over 200 
a go, so 5  absorptions and the core is  dead, and so are you.  The core 
actually absorbs lightning, so you  can effectively 'heal' the core for 700  
Hp a go with Volt  Bite, and  if  you are  desperate,  with  Spire.   
Whenever  the core  is absorbed 3  times, make it your  priority to heal  it, 
because if it  dies then you may as well reset.

Okay start by  Charming a Speed Tab from  the Core, have Frog use  Water on 
the Bottom to soften it.  Now go all out on the Bottom with,  if you are 
completing this  quest  early,  Ayla's  Cat  Attack and  Frog's  Slurp  Cut.  
If  you  are completing  this quest  after gaining  Crono then  you have  
better options  at your disposal, Triple Kick and Leap Slash, (and their Dual 
Tech, Drop Kick)

Once  you chew  down those  4000 Hp  the fight  becomes very  easy, repeat  
the previous process for the top and it will not last very long at all.

Now head over to  Fiona, drop off Robo, collect him in 1000  AD, go through 
the following  scenes,  and you'll  come  out  the  other  side with  our  
precious Green Dream!

**>-17-<***
12000 BC - Mt Woe
***********

Take your party into the Terra Cave, buy  30 Mid Tonics and 10 Revives and 
save downstairs. Now, we  need to purchase a new  weapon for Lucca at  the 
shop here too, we will need it for Rubble-slaying later.

Now equip your party members  :

Crono: Slasher & Wallet 
Robo : Gold Erng 
Ayla : Safe Helm, Dash Ring

I gave them  my best helms &  some element absorbing armour  (theyâ€™re still 
the best defensive armours available so far..)

When  you head  through downstairs  youâ€™ll  face 2  beasts, have  Ayla Charm  
a Rainbow Helm form each  of them while Crono uses Spincut,  Frog Leap Slash 
then finally Ayla  Rock Throwing (very effective).  Donâ€™t be surprised if  
you die.. These beasts are tough  in a LLG. Also in the bottom right  corner 
in this room is a Power Tab.

Give the 2 Rainbow  Helms to Frog & Crono these give very  decent defence and 
a very fancy but yet nearly useless 50% Lightning resistance.

Now heal up with  tonics (use an Ether on each character  too) and head 
through to face 2 more beasts, Charm them if you wish but kill them either 
way.

Now heal  everyone with Tonics,  use Mid ethers  on Ayla &  Frog & an  Ether 
on Crono, the next fight is pretty tough. Prepare your characters like so. 

Crono: Slasher, Rbow Helm, Element Mail, Wallet 
Frog : Masamune, Rbow Helm, Element Mail, Dash ring 
Ayla : Safe Helm, Element Mail, Gold Erng

When you try to head further youâ€™ll face a boss fight.

**********
Mud Imp
Red Beast - 5000 Hp
Blue Beast - 5000 Hp
**********

The Blue Imp  holds a Mermaid  Cap, and the Mud Imp  hold a Speed  Tab, both 
of which you  REALLY want.  Begin by  Charming both  off the  2 Beasts  and 
having Crono and Frog heal. If Crono falls donâ€™t revive.

Now have Frog  be the healer using Mid  Tonics and Ayla just  attack with 
Beast Tosses on the Red Beast. If Frog Falls  asleep have Ayla heal Frog with 
a Kiss, if the other way round have Frog heal  Ayla with Mid Tonics, if both 
asleep you may be  pretty much screwed.  Repeat the process  and eventually 
the  Red Beast will fall,  repeat the process  on the Blue  Beast (who will  
now counterattack every move against  him) then just wait  out the Imp, who  
will run eventually. Use a Mid Ether is necessary.

Do NOT be  surprised if you  get killed in this fight.  In total I  used 17 
Mid Tonics and 2 Mid Ethers on this fight.

Proceed  up  &  through the  mountain,  when  you  see  a rubble  set  up  
your characters as follows.

Crono: Wallet
Frog : Berserker
Ayla : Hit Ring

Button bash  A and  hope you  make the kill.  Rubbles earn  a Massive  100 
tech points and  a decent  1000 G, later  there is one  Rubble that  
respawns.. This Rubble will  be used to teach  all your characters  all your 
techs so  you must pay attention.

On this  mountain are  several monsters  which you  can charm  a LOT  of 
useful items from, when youâ€™re  not fighting rubbles equip Ayla with  the Gold 
Stud, use Frog to  heal in between fights  or Marle/Robo is  Frog runs out 
of  MP (switch Ayla for  Robo/Marle, heal,  reswitch, heal)  and use Mid  
Ethers on  Ayla when sheâ€™s  out of  MP. Keeping  the  Berserker on  Frog is  
not  a bad  idea as  the monsters here give decent Tech Points, Crono should 
hang onto the Wallet.

Hereâ€™s the Charm List for the Mountain.

Buntan Impâ€™s : Alloy Blade (Crono) 
Gargoyle : Big Hand (Robo) 
Stone Imp - Mid Ether 
Man Eater - Pearl Edge (Frog)

The respawning  Rubble is  on the second  screen on the  mountain, go  past 
the Save Point and itâ€™s  on your right on a â€˜Mini Islandâ€™ linked  by a chain 
(which you can walk  over). Now is your chance  to really grind some  tech 
points. The rubbles here give  100 Tech Points a go,  although it's a fair  
distance to the previous screen  in order to  make it respawn. The  evasion 
stat on  the rubble is insane  and even  Ayla, who has  lethal accuracy 
against  every boss  in the game struggles.  For Rubble  training you want  
to keep Ayla  in your  party at all  times and  either Robo,  Frog  or Lucca  
with  your party,  equip them  as follows:

Crono: Wallet
Spare Character: Hit Ring 
Ayla: Berserker

Crono's  Accuracy  is abysmal  even  with  the  hit  ring,  you want  to  
begin training with Robo 1st,  Frog 2nd and Lucca last (we  purchased her 
weapon from the shop specifically for this task)

Now you donâ€™t  actually have to teach  your characters every single  one of 
the techs they  will need *now*, because theyâ€™ll  be earning plenty  of Tech 
Points available in  subsequent fights. Marle  doesn't need  any techs until  
the very end  of the  game, and  there's  a very  convenient  source for  
all her  Tech Points at the black omen, so tech her nothing for now.

Here's the checklist of techs you need to learn here and now:

Crono - Confuse
Marle - Nothing
Robo - Uzzi Punch
Frog - Leap Slash
Lucca - Fire 2
Ayla - Dino Tail

It's pretty  tedious, and soul-destroying  process, you  really do not  want 
to spend  any more  time doing  this  then you  have to,  progressing 
through  the story will net a decent number of TP, and push Robo and Ayla to 
their finals.

Eventually you will want the following Techs:

Crono - Confuse
Marle - Life 2
Lucca - Fire 2
Frog - Water 2
Robo - Shock
Ayla - Triple Kick

Head  the rest  of the  way through  the mountain  with all  your lovely  
techs learnt, charming the enemies here, donâ€™t hesitate  to get more than one 
of each item because they sell for excellent G. 

Just before  you reach  Giga Gaia  youâ€™ll get a  Time hat  then youâ€™ll  reach 
a chain  bridge  which will  take  you  to Giga  Gaia,  on  the bottom  
right  of this screen is a Magic Tab, be sure to grab it and save.

Now you face probably the easiest boss ever, Giga Gaia.

***********
Giga Gaia
10000 Hp
***********

All you need to do is set up your characters like so... 
Crono: Black Mail & Wallet 
Robo : Red Vest & Hit Ring 
Ayla : Red Mail & Gold Stud

With both hands Giga Gaia only does 2 attacks 
2 Handed Attack : Double Fire Blaster 
2 Handed Attack : Double Shadow Blaster

Both of  these attacks do about  the same damage  but Giga Always uses  them 
in the following sequence: 
Shadow 
Fire 
Fire
Repeat

He uses the fire one 2x as much as his Shadow.. Hence with your brilliant 
Fire- Absorbing gear you  got earlier this battle is  a piece of cake.  Robo 
has some natural resistance to Shadow hence he gets away with using a Red 
Vest.

When the  battle starts have  Ayla Charm the  main body  for a Speed  tab, 
have Robo  Uzzi punch  the  main body  until  out of  MP, have  Crono  start 
with  a Spincut, then  soon after wiped  out by the Fire  Blaster (donâ€™t 
revive  him of course), have  Ayla Triple  Kick till  out of MP,  then just  
have Robo  & Ayla attack until the Main Body dies (donâ€™t attack the arms).

This is  one of  the most  annoyingly overlooked tactical  exploits for  one 
of the  most troublesome  bosses  players  have found,  who  needs  Falcon 
Hit  or Luminaire when you have the elemental mails!

After this easy  battle Mt Woe will fall  - hopefully youâ€™ve got  all the 
items and Tech Points you needed before then.

Now  head up the  Skyway  to Enhasa, open  the  3 Books here  in  correct 
order (Water - Wind  - Fire), this will open  a separate room where there  
are 6 Nu's which will  yield 2  Tabs if you  can win.  Falcon Hit and  Dino 
Tail  are good techs  to use  here,  but  try to  focus  on  1 Nu  as  a  
time otherwise,  and designate Crono  as the healer  here. Don't be 
surprised  if you lose,  keep at it!

Eventually you  reach Zeal Castle,  return to the  chamber you faced  Golem 
in, youâ€™ll face Dalton.

**********
Dalton
4000 Hp
**********

Let's put  our hard  earned techs to  use! In particular,  learn to  love 
Beast Toss, it  combines  the damage from  Robo's  Uzzi Punch and  Ayla's  
Rock Throw with  a  healthy multiplier  bonus.  The  result  is,  as  you 
can  see,  quite spectacular, 3 of them and Dalton is dead.

Now let me list the advantages of using Dual Techs

1.  100%   accuracy,   ignoring  enemies  evade   on   enemies  they  work   
on 2.  Enemies that  counterattack will  only  counter once,  and usually  
against the character issuing the command 3. Damage Bonus 4. Elemental 
addition to physical attacks

The  first advantage  is  what  really  makes Dalton  cake  here, as  his  
high evasion  is all  for nawt.  Dalton only  attacks and  counterattacks 
with  Iron Orb, the  only thing  that can  kill you  is his  death-counter, 
but  then just make sure you have  one character with above 200 Hp before  
the third and final beast toss and they will survive just fine

Now you proceed to Ocean Palace

**>-18-<***
12000 BC
Ocean Palace
***********

The Elemental  Mails  again will be  your  best friend here.  I  suggest 
giving making  a  Party  of  Ayla,  Frog  & Crono.  Give  each  of  them  a  
different Elemental  Mail  except Black  Mail,  give  Crono  the  Wallet, 
Ayla  the  Gold Stud & Frog the  Hit Ring. In here are several  elemental â€˜
Scoutsâ€™ whoâ€™s spells can be painful or not.

Hereâ€™s the Charm List of the area.

Yellow Scouts - Lapis
Red Scouts - Barrier 
Blue Scouts - Shield
Mage - Barrier
Barghest - Shield

We'll actually be  needing a good number  of barriers and shields  for the 
rest of the game, and  this is the best opportunity to charm them.  You will 
need 20 Barriers  and 20  Shields. If  you  are intending  on taking  on 
Ocean  Palaces Lavos (in  a New Game  +) you need  a total of 50  Shields, 
you can  split that load between 3 run-throughs however, but it's a job that 
does need doing.

I donâ€™t suggest fighting  to the finish on any of the scouts,  I do suggest 
you keep  switching your  Elemental Mailâ€™s  with respect  to the  scouts. 
Use  Leap Slash & Rock throw as attacking techniques, with Mid Ethers for MP.

Collect every Chest, you  should obtain the hidden Demon Hit  which is not 
only now Frogâ€™s strongest weapon  but gives him a huge 2x  damage for magic 
enemies, keep this on  Frog for now. You should  also pick up a few  very 
decent weapons for your other characters.

Now  you will  head  down some  stairs,  run  from every  fight  you see  
here. Eventually youâ€™ll meet  Masa who will show you the  cut-scene with 
Schala, head down  the stairs  after  this. Now  save  & use  a shelter,  
then  set up  your characters as follows..

Crono: Star Sword, MermaidCap, White Mail, Wallet 
Frog : Demon Hit, Râ€™bow Helm, Blue Mail, Hit Ring 
Ayla : Râ€™bow Helm, Red Mail, Gold Stud.

Now youâ€™ll reach  the elevator.. Where youâ€™ll fight 3  consecutive & very 
tough fights.

First youâ€™ll  Face 2 Blue scouts,  2 Yellow Scouts  & a Mage. Which..  you 
can run from.

As you starts descending the elevator youâ€™ll face

3 Thrashers & Jinn/Barghest combo: Use  a Rock  Throw  on  each  Thrasher to  
one-hit-kill  & avoid  the  powerful counter,  have Frog  normally attack  
the Jinn/Barghest  combo, heal  everybody with Mid Tonics & Mid Ethers is 
necessary just before finishing this.

2 Thrashers, 2 Mages & a Yellow Scout: Quickly take  out both Mages  by using 
one  Rock throw  or Leap Slash  on each, then  take out  the  Thrashers 
using  Aylaâ€™s Rock  Throws  while Frog  normally attacks the Yellow Scout, 
Heal with Mid Tonics just before finishing off. 

2 Red Scouts, 2 Yellow, 2 Blue: These scouts  are lethal.  Take out  2 Scouts 
of  the same  type. Use  the Drop Kick Duel Tech (Frog &  Ayla) to take each 
of them out in  one hit, now you can reduce the pace  and take out the other  
4 normally. The reason  why these need to be removed quickly  is because with 
3 Scouts of the  same element alive they can use  the Triple  Tech Delta  
Attack. Which  will lay  waste to  your feebly levelled party.

After this  fight heal  up with Mid  Tonics &  Give Mid Ethers  to both  Ayla 
& Frog. Now I  do suggest giving  the Black Mail & Vests  to Frog &  Ayla (I 
also Suggest giving Frog the  Mermaid cap & Ayla a Rainbow Helm).  Now you 
will need to  flick 2  switches, each  initiating  a battle  with  a set  of 
3  different scouts which  also can use  Delta Attack, the Black  Mail should 
save  you from dying in one round, you can escape from these.

After the second fight swap Frog out for Lucca & set them up accordingly.

Crono: Wallet
Lucca: Red Vest & Silver Stud 
Ayla : Safe Helm, Red Mail & Gold Stud

Soon you will face Golem Twins, which is another trivial battle.

**********
Golem x2
7000 Hp each
**********

Immediately  open out  this  fight with  Fire  2, this  will  make both  
Golems telecopy Fire magic.  This means the only 2  attacks they can hit  you 
with are Fire &  Fire  2..and because of  your  fire absorbing gear  these  
attacks wonâ€™t hurt you one bit.

Now if  you are  having trouble  getting in  that first  Fire 2,  try 
shuffling Ayla's  and Lucca's  positions in  the party  list, which  
hopefully will  stop Lucca being targeted at the start.

Once you do  get that Fire 2 in, the  battle is as good as won,  Ayla & Luccaâ€™
 s Dual Tech Fire Whirl deals  1000 damage to each and is a  great lazy way 
to win the fight. Before you  do that though make sure you charm a  Magic tab 
off each Golem. Using  Charm on the  Golem makes him  telecopy Physics 
however,  so make sure Lucca  *immediately* uses a  Fire after on the  Golem 
you charmed  from to change him back to Telecopy Fire before he gets an 
attack in.

After 7  Fire Whirls  both Golems  will pull  their Death  Counter at  the 
same time, Ayla will  survive this with about 100  Hp to spare, now you  
should be 2 Magic Tabs up :).

This  is  another   one  of  those  battles  that  the  general   FAQs  get  
so irritatingly  wrong, and  this battle  has  more quirky  and ambitious  
tactics discussed for  it than  any other,  ignore all of  them, this  is 
the  best and easiest way to defeat them, PERIOD.

Now, before  continuing make  sure to  de-equip Crono  of everything,  and 
most especially the Wallet!! We're  about to lose him for a short  while and 
we have many battles to face before we get him back.

Continue on through the following scenes and you will face...

**********
Lavos
30000 Hp
**********

This  Lavos is  very different  to the  forms you  will have  defeated on  
your previous gameplays, as  the Lavos at Ocean Palace boasts  triple the 
health and double (!)  the speed and  hitting power. It's  a complete joke  
how impossible he is  for a LLG  at this stage,  even with your  early 
Green Dream and  all the tabs in  the world. But  not to worry,  you will get  
your chance! For  now, we and Crono  must  part ways due  to  our 
incompetence at  defeating  said planet parasite.

Eventually youâ€™ll  reach solid ground,  if your low on  any items, go  buy 
them from the Nu in the shop (be sure to Grab the Magic Tab behind him).

Now  before  you  progress  farther,  we  must  prepare  our  party  
carefully: 
Slot 1 - Frog: Safe Helm, Wallet 
Slot 2 - Ayla: Gold Erng 
Slot 3 - Robo: Gold Stud

Optimise your other equipment, to Frog 1st and Robo 2nd, Ayla last.

Having the Wallet holder  in the lead is critical, as  we'll gain Exp 
otherwise in the next section,  Ayla can still fight without her  equipment, 
so make sure she's not in Slot 1.

**>-19-<***
12000 AD
Blackbird
***********

Now progress through  as normal, getting Frog's equipment from  the chest 
with the sleeping  guard next to  it, now you are  safe to plough  head-first 
through the section and  grab everything. Damage does  rack up very quickly  
if you are not  careful, especially  on  Ayla if  she  hasn't got  her  
armour back.  Heal copiously and proceed cautiously.

Upstairs  on the  roof are  a few  turrets.  These give  great AP  but they  
do painfully attack  with Shadow Lasers. I  suggest setting up your  
characters as goes.

Frog: Demon Hit, Black Mail, Hit Ring 
Ayla: Black Vest, Berserker 
Robo: Best Weap, Dark Mail, Wallet

Fight all the  turrets one at a time, if  youâ€™re lucky youâ€™ll kill one  or two 
of them.. Donâ€™t get too hopeful however.  Eventually in the bottom-left tip 
of the wing youâ€™ll face Golem Boss.

**********
Golem Boss
15000 Hp
**********

Seeing as how the  original Golem was torn to shreds by  our new strategy, 
what better way to celebrate  then by beating on his bigger  cousin! This 
like Golem is also  an optional  boss, in  fact it's simply  just a  race to  
hack through 15000 Hp before he automatically runs away. He has no attacks of 
his own so equip your characters as follows:

Frog: Demon Edge, Wallet 
Ayla: Gold Stud 
Robo: Silver Stud

Ayla is fast  enough to get  in almost 2 turns for  every 1 of  Robo's, so 
with each of Ayla's  'free' turns have her  triple kick, and when  their 
their turns coincide use a  Beast Toss, with the battle  speed set to 
slowest  it should be straightforward to  get a  good sync. Have  Frog Leap 
Slash  over and  over and you should  take down Golem Boss  just before he  
runs away, and just  when you run out  of MP on all  3 characters (if  you 
do, use  a Mid Ether on  Ayla with Frog and switch to  just Triple Kicks and 
attacks). If you  manage to kill him, well  done! Have  40  TP for  your  
troubles,  if not,  no  problem, take  your frustrations out on Dalton, who 
is next.

**********
Dalton Plus
3000 Hp
**********

Dalton Plus  has no Death-Counter like before,  just whack him  with your 
techs and he  wonâ€™t last 20 seconds,  you shouldnâ€™t even need  to heal if you  
began at full.

Now you will gain  control of the Epoch. Now you must enter  North Cape to 
meet Magus, now let me put a few notes down here.

Another major  point I  have changed in  this FAQ is  the insistence  on 
taking Magus, albeit not  using him.  Magus is  an incredibly strong  
character at  level 37. He's a  full 17  levels stronger  then Ayla,  who is  
already a  formidable and useful tank against  almost every boss in the  
game. So strong is  he that much of the  challenge of the rest  of the game  
is moot if  you opt to use  him. So for  the purposes  of  this FAQ,  we  will 
not  be using  Magus  for any  future fights, and whether  you take him or  
not I will leave  to personal preference, his  effect on  the  party  
average  really had  no  bearing whatsoever  on  the challenge but  I will 
leave  you each to your  own philosophies whether  or not to take him.

Now if you  do intend on  taking Magus on, what better  way to do  it than 
with Frog alone! 

Now hopefully  you have  been busy  charming at  Ocean Palace,  as you  will 
be needing those Barriers now, and just 2 isn't going to cut it this time!

You're  also going  to need  30 Mid  Tonics  and a  few Mid  Ethers, which  
you should have already have plenty of.

Also now  you are aware  you will be  using, and  needing your Barriers,  it 
is wise  to speed  up your  battle speed  gauge  in order  to allow  them to  
last longer. However  we aren't  critically rationed  on these items  as we  
were in our first fight,  so setting to fastest  isn't necessary, but I  
suggest you do as you will have fewer periods in which you are fully exposed 
to his attacks.

There are 2 good equipment setups for Frog, I recommend this one:

Set A:
Demon Hit
Mermaid Cap
White Mail
Wallet

If you're having a lot of trouble with Magus then try this one

Set B:
Demon Hit
Lightning Cap
Red Mail
Wallet

The differences will be explained shortly

**********
Magus
6666 Hp
**********

Now the first  phase is straightforward, Magus moves very  slowly and only 
uses his scythe, must  like out last fight  with Magus we need  to prepare 
carefully before knocking  him into his second phase.  Exactly 12 Slurp  Cuts 
(they can't miss) at  270 damage each will  bring Magus down  to ~3400, you 
can  keep track of the number  of times you have done  this by monitoring 
Frog's  MP, when Frog has  used  24  MP  (he  begins  with  37  MP)  then  
you  are  ready  to  begin preparations for his next phase.

Heal Frog's MP with a  Mid Ether and then use a Barrier,  wait for Magus to 
hit Frog and  then immediately  use a  Mid Tonic,  and before  Magus gets  
his next turn in, use Frog's  leap slash for 450 damage to knock him  hard 
into his next phase,  if you  did everything  right  you should  be  at full  
health when  he counters you, now you  have to be careful, as Magus will  now 
attack with level 2 elementals,  along with his scythe, with  much greater 
speed  then his first phase. Furthermore  he will counter attack  anything 
against him with  a random level 2 elemental, this is where your equipment 
setup comes in.

With Set A Magus's spells will deal the following Lightning 2: ~150 Hp of 
Healing Ice 2:  ~60 Dmg Fire 2: ~150 Dmg

With Set B:
Lightning 2: ~70 Dmg
Ice 2: ~ 133 Dmg
Fire 2: ~160 Hp of Healing

Heal Frog  whenever he falls  below 160 Hp,  now the  reason why I  suggest 
you try  Set A  first is  because from  my  tests against  him, he  appears 
to  use Lightning 2 far  more than Fire 2,  and gave more opportunities  to 
attack, but Set A carries  a greater risk as Fire 2  with Set A deals more  
damage than Set B (because  of Frog's small  inherent Water resistance),  but 
see how  it works out.

Now  Frog has  258  Health,  which  quite frankly  means  he cannot  survive  
2 consecutive  Fire 2's (or  Ice  2's with Set  B),  Magus will always  get  
in 2 spells in  for every  time you  attack (1  from his  counterattack, 1  
from his turn move),  so if you  see these 2  spells in a row,  bad luck, 
try  again. We have to  roll the dice  a few times  in this fight to  get the 
result  we want. Furthermore you must watch  Frog carefully at all times, 
and  as soon as Frog's barrier goes down, it  must be replaced, as without it 
you will  not be able to cope for long against Magus's onslaught.

For  this phase  you need  to play  very defensively,  do not  even think  
about attacking him  and hoping  for the best!  The only time  you can  
safely attack Magus is immediately  after Magus uses a Lightning  2 (or Fire 
2 w/  Kit B), at which point  you now have a  chance to attack with  a Leap 
Slash and  heal from the 2  attacks you will  be hit with,  always keep  Frog 
above 160  Hp, healing copiously with  Mid Tonics and waiting.  7 Successful 
Leap Slashes  will bring Magus down once for all, good luck!

Now once you win, you can decide for yourself whether or not to recruit Magus.

Now we must  rescue Crono, but before you  do that make a  detour to 
65000000BC and obtain  3 Ruby Armors  (you should have plenty  of trading 
items  left from the Nu-Slaying before), now onwards to Death Peak!

**>-20-<***
2300 AD - Death peak
**********

For the purposes  of this challenge, it  is intended that Crono  remains in 
the party  wherever possible,  and  for sentiment's  sake, to  also  remain 
in  the lead! Form  a party  of Frog  Robo and  Ayla to  rescue our  level 1  
hero from death's clutches.

Now another  important preparation is  Ayla, you should  have by now  after 
all your  battles since  your Rubble-grinding  at Mt  Woe have  gotten 
Ayla's  last tech -  Triple Kick,  and if  not should only  need a  few more  
TP to  get it, fight enemies in the area,  or if you need quite a few  then 
the Nu at 65000000 BC should suffice  to push her over the  edge, you will 
need it  in the upcoming battles.

Now head  around Death Peak  like you normally  would, however just  before 
you face off against the first Lavos Spawn set up your 3 Characters 
accordingly:

Frog: Demon Hit, Safe Helm, Ruby Armor, Wallet 
Ayla: Rainbow Helm, Ruby Armor, Gold Stud 
Robo: Best Weap, Rainbow Helm, Ruby Armor, Gold Erng

A/N: I  haven't gotten around  to play testing with  the Swallow, for  those 
of you  wanting to  try  a Minimum-Tabs  game.  This is  probably  the most  
major example where the strategy will need to be changed.

Try this equipment set-up: 
Frog: Demon  Hit, Rainbow Helm/Vigil Hat, Ruby Armor, Silver Erng/Green Dream 
Ayla: Rainbow Helm, Ruby Armor, Wallet 
Robo: Best Weap, Rainbow Helm, Ruby Armor, Gold Erng

You can  also try  swapping around Silver  & Gold Erngs,  and if  you 
completed Fiona's Forest early,  you should have access to the  Vigil Hat and 
Green Dream, in which  case if Vigil  Hat doesn't let Frog  survive the 
opening  attack, the Green Dream will.

**********
Lavos Spawn
Head - 4000 Hp
**********

With This Set Up all 3 should survive the opening attack.

Now, sadly our  almighty Beast Toss dual tech  that works so well  on Dalton 
is ineffective against  Lavos Spawn, but  not to  worry, we have  something 
almost as good -  Drop Kick! Which combines Leap  Slash and Triple Kick,  
with a small damage bonus  and without  the inaccuracies.  Now here  I went  
all out  on the head with  Drop Kick  and Uzzi  Punches, not  bothering to  
heal anyone,  as we only have  4000 Hp to hack  through, and should  be able 
to deplete  that well before the second  round of needles. Do  not bother 
charming the  head, it only holds an elixir.

If youâ€™re having trouble  here then perhaps you should designate  Robo or Frog 
to be  the healer  with Lapisâ€™  (hopefully  you should  have Charmed  a 
few)  and have three other 2 Characters to go all  out. If the healer gets hit 
by chaos or sleep then Designate Robo to be the healer.

If you canâ€™t kill him before his 2nd  wave of attacks then you should make 
Ayla a â€˜Tankâ€™ with the following set up.

Ayla: Safe Helm, Ruby Armour, Gold Erng. 
Robo: Best Weap, Rainbow Helm, Ruby Armour, Silver Erng Frog: Demon Hit, 
Rainbow Helm, Ruby Armour Left, Dash ring.

Ayla will easily survive the opening  attack, revive Frog and designate Ayla 
to be the healer with  Frog using Leap Slash and Ayla using  Mid Tonics & 
Revives. Now head back & heal with a Shelter.

Proceed  back through,  collecting the  new  weapons in  the chests  as you  
go along,  youâ€™ll face  another  Lavos Spawn  which  is exactly  the  same 
as  the first. Repeat the  above strategy to kill  him. Head out and  head 
with another Shelter, now proceed further along.

Eventually youâ€™ll face  a 3rd Lavos Spawn. Again repeat  the above strategy 
for him. Now go retrieve your almighty Level One Crono, make sure you donâ€™t 
lose the fool again :).

Now you have access to the flying Epoch,  ahead of us we have a series of 
side- quests available  and Lavos  himself. If  you try  to fight  Lavos now  
you can probably  be quite  confident youâ€™ll  get  shredded. Here  is the  
list of  the available  side-quests and  the important  items  that they  
make available  on completion.

Sun Stone: Sun Shades

Rainbow Shell: Prism Helms, Prism Specs & Rainbow

Geno Dome: Crisis & Terra Arm Weapons & Ribbon for Robo

Northern Ruins: Nova/Moon Armor, and a nigh useless upgraded Masamune.

Fionaâ€™s Forest: Green Dream

Ozzie's Fort: Nothing

So, let's get cracking!

Now, you  will want  to do  Sunken Desert  first, if  you haven't  completed 
it already. The section still applies now as it did then, except this time 
you have better weapons to whack him with.

**>-21-<***
Rainbow Shell Side Quest
***********

This will  be a tough  side quest, but  nothing but  a bump in  your 
(unstable) road. Now proceed through he quest as per usual, at the Giantâ€™s  
Claw, make your party of anyone  who you like (+Crono!), keep the Wallet  on 
Crono. If you wish  to do  any charming  then youâ€™ll  need Ayla.  Personally 
I  ran from  all fights because they were all very tough. 

There are  a few Rubbles  in the area,  now at this  point only Robo  and 
Marle probably need tech  points, Robo's Shock being more  immediately 
important than Marle's Life  II. So  form a  party with Robo  Ayla and  Crono 
to  tackle them, with the equipment setup suggested before, albeit with newer 
weapons.

Along with  a Power tab  in here there  is also  the Frenzy Band, which  you 
are going to need if you plan on tacking Ocean Palace's Lavos in a NG+

Eventually youâ€™ll face Rust Tyrano.

***********
Rust Tyrano
25000 Hp
***********

Rust Tyrano  has a Red  Mail that can  be Charmed off  him. Which we  shall 
do. Make up a Party of Crono, Ayla & anyone else (recommend Robo).

I gave them the following set up.

Crono: Red Mail, Hit Ring 
Ayla : Ruby Armour, Wallet 
Robo : Red Vest, Gold Stud

Have Ayla  charm the Red  Mail then Triple Kick,  then attack until  dead. 
Have Robo use  Uzzi Punch until  out of MP, then  just normally attack.  Rust 
Tyrano has only 2  attacks that can  hurt you, which are his  2 bites. 2  
bites on the same character  will kill  him, so  just revive  that 
character.  Keep hacking away at those 25000 Hp's and Rust Tyrano will 
eventually fall.

After the following scenes go to 1000 AD, Guardia Castle.

Make sure your inventory is prepared:

30 Revives
50 Mid Tonics

The upcoming  fight with  Yakra is very  tough, and we're  also forced  to 
have Marle in our party what's worse.

Proceed through as you normally would. Form a party of Crono Ayla and Marle

**********
Yakra
20000 Hp
**********

Having Ayla with you lets you charm an extra White Mail.

I suggest setting up your characters as follows.

Crono: Slasher, Vigil/Sight Hat & Speed Belt 
Marle: Wallet 
Ayla : Safe Helm, Ruby Armour & Amulet

A/N: Another battle  I recall where the Safe Helm  was infinitely valuable, 
try this equipment set-up:

Crono: Slasher & Speed Belt 
Marle: Wallet 
Ayla : Vigil Hat, Ruby Armour & Gold Erng

And you'll  need a stock of  50 Full Tonics,  use these in place  of Mid- 
Tonics and use the same strategy, except keeping Ayla's health always above 
380.

Thereâ€™s not  much in Yakra at  first when you  fight him, Charm the  White 
Mail off him at the start  and just use Rock Throw with Ayla,  let Crono & 
Marle die & stay  dead. Make  sure Aylaâ€™s  Hp is at  least 250  throughout. 
In  fact your only source of damage this fight should be Ayla's Rock Throws

As soon  as Yakra  blurts out  â€˜Heard it about  it from  the Ancestorsâ€™  he 
has switched into  his second phase,  and will  perform a target-all  needle 
attack that will  kill Crono and Marle  and hit Ayla  for 250, make sure  
she's healed immediately before! Now, after  the needles hit,  Yakra will 
throw  a set of  single-target needles attacks in  rapid  succession, almost 
as  quickly  as Ayla gets  turns  in, you need  to  fast on  the  ball  
here.  Have  Ayla  heal herself  constantly  with Mid/Full Tonics  (Use a 
full tonic  if she dips  below 70 Hp) and  she *should* ride out the storm  
on the other side, alive. Once she  does, revive Crono, his role now is  to 
heal Ayla and to  distract fire from her,  have Ayla constantly Rock Throw  
Yakra, and  Crono constantly healing  Ayla with  Mid Tonics/Ethers, so not 
spend a  turn attacking with Crono, just leave his  turn available if he gets 
his early. If Crono  falls, immediately revive him with  Ayla, Yakra will  
use his target- all attack  again a few  times followed by  the needle 
barrage  onslaught, ride out the storm the same way as before then revive 
Crono. Repeat this process and after 40 Rock Throws Yakra should fall.

Now you have the  choice between a Prism Dress or 3 Prism  Helms. Here, we 
will be wanting  the Helms, we  will eventually need the  Prism Dress later,  
but we can charm Mother Brain for that (those!).

Now first place I suggest you go to is the Sun Palace in 2300 AD.

**>-22-<***
Sun Stone Side Quest
***********

When you reach the palace  you must fight Son of the Sun.  I suggest you form 
a party of Crono, Marle & Ayla.

The  reason why  I chose  Marle  was because  she  needs Tech  Points, and  
any character really can  do this battle. I chose  Ayla because the Son  of 
the Sun has a Black Mail that can be charmed off him. And Charm we will!

**********
Son of Sun
2200 Hp
**********

If Robo  still  needs Shock then  use  him, otherwise pick  Marle,  their 
roles will be identical. Equip your characters something like this.

Crono: Slasher, Red Vest, Wallet 
Marle/Robo: Red Mail, Dash Ring 
Ayla : Red Mail, Charm Top.

You will need at least 20 revives for this fight.

The  main reason why  we  did the Rainbow  Shell  quest first was  to  get 
that second Red  Mail, making  this fight  a hundred times  easier, and  
faster too. Now do not forget to charm the core, as it holds a Black Mail.

Now the  only thing that  the Son of  Sun can do that  will deal any  damage 
is his Shadow Beam attack  that targets a single character, at  our levels 
it's an instant  KO so  just revive  the fallen  character, besides  that we  
shouldnâ€™t have any  need to  heal in this  fight, find  the correct flame  
and hit  it 10 times to get the Moon Stone.

Now after  the  shenanigans with converting  the  Moon Stone to  a  Sun 
Stone, you'll get your hands  on the Sun Shades, and more  importantly, when 
you speak to Melchior will  yield the PrismSpecs (!) and Rainbow  (!!). This 
weapon alone lets Crono  far surpass  Ayla and  Robo in damage  capability, 
and  an integral part of most upcoming boss fights as a result.

**>-23-<***
Geno Done Side Quest
***********

Robo must  be in the  lead, Crono will  take the second  spot and you  can 
pick between  Ayla and  Frog  for  the  third spot,  I  recommend Ayla  
despite  her increasing  redundancy in  the offense,  she's very  effective 
as  a tank  with more health and defence than any other character..

Equip your characters like this, this Dome is VERY tough. 

Robo : Best Weap, Safe Helm, Black Mail, Gold Stud. 
Crono: Rainbow, Black Vest, Wallet 
Ayla : Best Weap, Prism Helm, Gold Erng

The Shadow attacks used by the Robots  will gives you a few free turns, 
however they more  often use physical  attacks. Crono and  Ayla's Dual tech  
Falcon Hit is  especially  effective  here  and  will one  hit  kill  all  
monsters  on  a horizontal on  the belt. Spam  Rock Throws,  Crono's Normal 
Attack  and Robo's Uzzi Punch  at liberal otherwise,  Your Shadow Absorbing  
armour will buy  you a few free  turns  but most of  their  attacks are 
physical.  Heal  copiously and don't be surprised if you die here.

After this battle swap the armours on Crono  and Ayla so Ayla has the Black 
Vest Now after  this proceed through the factory  like you normally  would. 
With the laser guards  I suggest just waiting these  out letting the  Shadow 
Lasers heal you until they Self Destruct. After you  grab the 2 Dolls, but 
when you collect the from opening it's  door with switches (i.e. not the one  
where you short out that Proto Guard), examine under where it was sat for a 
Speed tab.

Swap Roboâ€™s Black mail for a Red Mail before you fight Atropos.

**********
Atropos
**********

Just have Robo heal  himself with Cure Beam, when she  starts using Area 
Bombs, lay your feet up and  wait for her to stop, you wonâ€™t need  to put the 
Wallet on Robo, donâ€™t worry.

After  Atropos  stops  sheâ€™ll  give  Robo   her  Ribbon,  which  gives  Robo  
a *permanent* +3 Speed & +10 Magic Defence Stat Boost. Not bad, at all!

Go into  the room just above  where you fought  Atropos and grab the  Magic 
Tab hidden in there. Now you must face the Mother Brain.

**********
Mother Brain & 3 Panels 
Mother Brain - 5500 Hp 
Panels - 1 Hp each
**********

As you  can see the  Mother Brain has  very little  Hp compared to  your 
recent bosses but she  has 3 Panels that heal her  1000 Hp a hit. In  your 
normal game you  most likely  wiped  out all  3  panels  then killed  the  
mother brain  in seconds. Well it turns out  thatâ€™s not an option in a LLG 
since  the mother brain breaks out with loads of party hitting attacks which 
are nearly all one-hit-kills.

I suggest making a party of Robo, Crono & Ayla and equipping them like this.

Robo : Black Mail, Gold Stud 
Crono: Black Vest, Wallet 
Ayla : Black Mail, Silver Stud.

Also set your battle speed to 8 (fastest)

Even if you  take just 2 of the displays  out the Mother Brain is  still a 
pain as it gets itâ€˜s turns so damn fast. Take  2 out at the start then use 
Dual Tech Boogie which affects the  last Panel with the Stop Status. Now as  
far as I can tell, Boogie is  similar to Barrier and Shield, where  its 
affliction period is determined by  real-time, and  so the  faster the 
battle  speed, the  longer it effectively lasts.  Now once  you inflicted  
Stop on  the panel,  go all  out on Mother Brain, Use  Triple Kick, Uzzi 
punch  and Spincut (until out  of MP, then use normal  attack), you  should 
be able  to kill off  Mother Brain  before the panel becomes  active again, 
otherwise  use Boogie  again and hack  through her health.

Mother Brain has a Blue Mail in it, which you will probably want to charm.

After this youâ€™ll receive the Terra & Crisis Arm (!) for Robo.

**>-24-<***
Northern Ruins Side Quest
***********

The monsters  in here  are very, very  tough. And can  only really  be 
affected effectively by elemental attacks, for this reason we need Lucca.

Now that we have  Crono, Robo & Luccaâ€™s best weapons, now we  must get Frogâ€™s 
& Marleâ€™s best  weapons and  some decent gear.  Go and repair  the ruins  how 
you normally would. The monsters  here are very tough, as some  can only be 
damaged by magical  attacks. Here I suggest  a party of  Crono, Lucca & 
Robo.  At least equip them with the following.

Crono: Rainbow & Gold Stud 
Lucca: Taban Suit & SilverStud 
Robo : Terra Arm & Wallet

You are definitely going to need a few Ethers here.

On the  Sentryâ€™s use Lucca &  Cronoâ€™s dual Tech  Fire Sword on the  Sentryâ€™s, 
or Fire  Sword 2  if it  will  hit more  than  one. These  will be  one-hit- 
kills. Despite most  damage comes from  Cronoâ€™s Rainbow strength,  it being 
in  a Dual Tech means we can bypass Crono's normally abysmal accuracy.

Itâ€™s  important you  heal  between fights  here. For  skeletons  & defunct,  
I suggest again using  the Dual tech Fire Sword  2 again for 2300  Damage on 
each Skeleton or normal Fire Sword for 1700 damage (one-hit-kills).

When you reach Cyrusâ€™s  grave, swap Frog in to get his  Masamune, then go 
after the Siren, Valkerye.  Make sure you replace  Robo with Lucca &  give 
the Wallet to Frog,  because as  of now Frog  is stronger than  Robo 
although  Roboâ€™s Uzzi Punch does make up for it, Frogâ€™s cheaper to use for 
now.

Now when you get close to the Shiva  Edge & Valkerye youâ€™ll face a few 
monsters that can  be a pain (save  beforehand please). On  the Baseâ€™s & 
Defuncts  use a single  Fire Sword  on  each for  a  One-Hit-Kill, have  
Frog  Leap Slashing  a separate enemy  to the Fire  Sworded ones to  shorten 
the battle,  because they can and will kill you if youâ€™re not careful.

Now when you reach  the 3 Chests, of course say no. Return  to 1000 AD, 
collect the powered up Valkerye, Shiva Edge & Moon  Armour, Return to 600 AD 
to grab the Kali Blade, Siren & Nova Armour.

Now it may  be worth noting that Robo  with the Prism Helm, Moon  Armour & 
Gold Erng and Atroposâ€™s built in Ribbon Robo  will have a very nice 49 magic 
Defence with 487 Hp. This  Set Up will allow Robo to  survive many normally 
devastating magical attacks much more easily.

**>-25-<***
Ozzieâ€™s Fort Side Quest
***********

Eurgh this is by  no means necessary or even helpful towards completing a LLG 
but  I promised at the start that  this  guide details on  all  Side Quests 
and,  well  thatâ€™s exactly what I am going to do.

Ok you know where this place is. Take  Crono, Robo & Frog. Weâ€™re going to 
blast our way in. Equip them.. 

Crono: Wallet 
Ayla : Prism Helm, Prism Specs
Robo : Safe helm, Best Armours & Gold Stud

3 Tosses on Flea and Slash make very short work of them.

Heal up and  repeat same for Slash. Now  in the room with the  anvil that 
Ozzie turns, go  grab the Magic Tab. Before  you leave  the room,  if you 
want the Items  from Slash, Flea &  Ozzie, go outside, heal, save and equip 
them.

Crono: Rainbow, Black Vest, Wallet 
Robo : Terra Arm, Safe Helm, Black Mail, Prism Specs 
Ayla : Prism Helm, Black Mail, Gold Erng

Note:  This  strategy   is  aimed  at  completionists  like   myself  who  
want everything, including the  unique items they hold. But by  all means 
ignore the charming parts of the strategy if you aren't interested.

**********
Ozzie, Slash & Flea
Great Ozzie - 6000 Hp
Super Slash - 4000 Hp
Flea Plus - 4000 Hp
**********

Start with Slash, Charm off him and pray  it hits. Have Robo & Crono just 
heal, if Crono  dies Revive him  with Robo only if you have  a free turn.  
After the Charm open with Dual tech Beast Toss for obscene damage, you want 
to hold Crono's turn as he cannot survive any counterattacks, instead have 
him heal and use a Shield on Ayla.  Youâ€™ll be hit by a counter, if  Crono is  
alive heal the injured character.  Now hit  Slash again with another Beast 
Toss and Slash should be  dead. Now the pressure is really let off on you. 
Repeat  the same  for Flea  now then  Ozzie, using  Elixirs, Ethers  & 
Mid/Full Tonics when needed.

A/N: Your  Black armour  should defend  you against  their Triple  Attack 
Delta Force which normally wipes the whole party.

After go grab  the Dash ring & Sight  Cap, go sink Ozzie. Now  you have 
finished all side quests. The Black Omen & Lavos stand before you.

**>-26-<***
The Black Omen
***********

Inside here  are several bosses of  which some of  them will be very  easy, 
or hard depending  on what game you  are playing. This  is where I will  
begin the crossroads between  the no-tabs and  regular playthrough.  If you 
are  going to attempt a regular playthrough then you want to:

Use Speed  Tabs on  Robo, then Crono  until they  are both at  a maximum  of 
15 Speed, and then dump  any remaining ones on Marle, if  any. It's only 
important to get Robo's speed up right at this moment. Use all Magic and Pwr 
Tabs on Robo.

Now before you enter, make sure you fulfil the following checklist:

Now make sure you have the following list of items: 99 Mid Tonics 60 Full 
Tonics 40 Ethers
40 Mid Ethers
15 Shelters
99 Revives
10 Barriers and Shields

This lot of  items should be plenty enough  to get you through  this place, 
and you do need  a fair bit of  luck. Now go to the  Black Omen in 1000  AD 
(so you can play through it again when you complete it).

Now you must stand  before the Black Omen. Bring Crono Frog &  Robo with you 
as theyâ€™re the best physical characters you have. Now equip them.

Crono: Wallet
Frog : Prism Helm, Black Mail, Silver Erng 
Robo : Prism Helm, Black mail, Gold Erng

Youâ€™ll start  off by fighting  Laser Guards. Just  wait these out,  the 
healing from  your Black  Mail  is sufficient  for  one character  to  
survive all  the explosions.

Now  you must  make  a  few  preparations if  you  are attempting  the  
regular playthrough. Go to 65000000  BC and fight the Frogs at  the hunting 
range there until Roboâ€™s  Hp is  exactly 319  (highest Hp  possible ending  
with a  9). Now I suggest you finish  off the fight using Roboâ€™s Uzzi Punch  
on the Frogs (with the cursor  in memory mode),  Aylaâ€™s beast toss &  Cronoâ€™s 
Spin cut.  Heal with Tonics and Ethers after this, we need to Robo 
specifically at 319 Hp.

**********
Mega Mutant
Top - 4500 Hp
Bottom - 4000 hp
**********

Crono: Rainbow, & Wallet 
Robo : Crisis, Prism Helm, Moon Armour & Prism Specs 
Ayla :  Prism helm, Lumin Robe, Sun Shades

This fight  is normally incredibly tough, as  you can probably  tell by 
reading the no-tabs strategy guide for this fight.

Now with this  equipment set-up we have basically geared  up our characters 
for an all-out  assault. Our trust  tech Beast Toss,  coupled with the  Sun 
Shades, Prism  Specs, The  Crisis  Arm and  all  the Pwr  Tabs we  gave  Robo 
are  just itching to deal something quite special.

So open  out this fight  with Beast Toss, Robo  and Ayla should  be 
comfortably fast  enough to get  this  turn in before  either  bit of the  
Mega  Mutant can move,  and result  is  spectacular. 3700  damage  (!!!), 
now  just  1 hit  from Crono's  Spincut will  finish off  the  bottom half  
before he  can even  move, effectively bypassing his  extremely annoying 
Chaotic Zone attack.  If you don't get the attacks  in perfectly, or is  
Crono misses, reset and  right Spekkio to change the battle parameters, and 
try it again, this should not be hard.

Once the  bottom is down you  should have ample time  to finish off the  top, 
2 beast tosses and  it's done, the fight is very  straightforward once the 
bottom falls.

No-Tabs Strategy:

As mentioned  before, all the  bosses where possible  I will provide  a no- 
tabs strategy too,  Megamutant is  one of the  toughest bosses in  the game  
with no tabs and  requires some luck  and a  well scripted opening.  
Megamutant's first few moves  are preset so a step-by-step  strategy is 
possible.  Now, the bottom has  4000 Hp,  if we  can  kill it  with both  
Ayla  and Robo  still alive,  or Ayla/Robo at full  health, we win, as the  
top is very manageable  alone. But as it is, it's effectively 2 bosses at the 
same time!

You will need:
2 Megalixirs
2 Barriers
4-5 Lapis
5 Full Tonics
2-3 Elixir
Battle speed - Slowest
Fast Reactions
Some luck

There are  a handful of  Megalixirs available in chests  at this point,  one 
of which being at Guardia Castle, consult Phoenix's FAQ for the others.

Equip your party exactly like so: 
Crono: Slasher, Wallet 
Ayla: Prism Helm, Lumin Robe, SilverErng 
Robo: Prism Helm, Moon Armor, Gold Erng

In order to  win we must string together  a series of attacks,  with this 
setup both  Ayla and  Robo  are maximally  defended  against  its strongest  
attacks, particularly chaotic  zone. With  this set-up  both Crono  and Ayla  
should get their first  turn in before  Chaotic Zone  very comfortably, Robo  
however will not, and  is the reason  why we cannot  opt for the  same simple 
strategy  as we would with tabs.

Now you must do the following:

Crono uses Barrier on Ayla/Robo Ayla uses Barrier on Ayla/Robo
*Bottom Half uses Chaotic Zone (220 To all) 
Robo uses a Lapis 
Ayla Triple Kicks (650)
*Top Half uses Mutant Gas (100 to one) 
Button Half uses Spike Attacks (100 to one) 
Robo either uses Lapis or Full  Tonic/Elixir(if only Ayla) on hurt 
character(s) 
Ayla triple Kicks (650)
*Top Half uses Blacken (350 to 1 character)
*Bottom Half uses Hp Down (0 Dmg) 
Robo  uses  Elixir   on  Ayla  if  she's  hurt,    or   a  Megalixir  
otherwise Ayla Triple Kicks (650)
*Spike & Absorption (100 each) 
Robo uses a Megalixir 
Ayla Triple Kicks (650)
*Chaotic Zone & Mutant  Gas Poison (Ayla and Robo will  barely survive), and 
at 8 speed, your Barriers will just about expire after this Beast Toss 
(1700), finishes bottom.

The top  half will probably kill a  character immediately after  this, but 
have the survivor  Full Tonic  himself and they  should get a  chance to  
revive the other quite  easily after.  Now just  attack with Beast  Toss and  
Triple Kicks and the top  half will not last long.  You can replenish yours  
Barriers too if you wish, but it shouldn't be necessary.

After this fast paced fight you finally have access to the Black Omen.

After this fight equip your Characters:

Crono: Rainbow, Prism Helm, Black Vest, Wallet 
Robo : Terra Arm, Prism helm, Black Mail, Gold Erng 
Ayla : Prism Helm, Black Mail, Silver Erng.

Note: the Silver Erng on Ayla will be replaced with a Gold Erng shortly.

This Set-up will get  you through most the Black Omen. As  most of the 
monsters here use Shadow Attacks.  You want to charm a lot of the  enemies 
here. You can Charm an  Extra Gold  Erng off  the Synchrites.  Give this  
extra Gold  Erng to Ayla.

Now go save &  use a Shelter. Now head through and youâ€™ll  fight 2 Panels. 
EACH Panel holds  a charmable  Speed Tab.  So guess  what weâ€™re  going to  
do. Charm them! Panels  arenâ€™t the easiest of  enemies at all,  with 1875 Hp 
and  they do quite heavy damage with missiles and  rarely use healable Shadow 
attacks. Charm one of the panels  while Robo Uzzi Punches & Crono Attacks  
it, then repeat for the other.  If Robo isnâ€™t  ** Speed Yet,  give the Tabs 
to  him now. If  he is, give them to Crono. Heal at the Save point or use Mid 
Tonics & Ethers.

Now straight  after this fight  youâ€™ll fight another  2 Panels, both  holding 
a Speed Tab each. Charm  a Speed tab off each then kill them.  Heal with 
Ethers & Mid Tonics again. 

Head through  and equip a Red  Armor on each  character, now run from  the 
Orbs in there (youâ€™ll absorb the Flare attacks).

In the next room are Metal Mutes, Equip  a White Armour on each character & 
run from them, however  when you face Flycops,  Charm an Extra Gold  Stud off 
them, this will come useful later.

Head up the teleporter & out onto a  lift. Make sure everyone is healed to 
Full Hp &  Mp. I  suggest giving  everyone Black Armour.  If you  face Goons  
on the elevator, the chances are youâ€™re going to have  to open your save in 
the 
next few seconds. If you face anyone else you should have no problem.

**********
Goons x2
3000 Hp each
**********

Iâ€™ll treat these  2 like a boss for those  of you who unlucky enough run 
into  them. They have about 3000  Hp each,  and are  VERY tough. Chances  are 
you  canâ€™t beat  them. I suggest  you go  all out  with Cronoâ€™s  Spin Cut,  
Roboâ€™s Uzzi  punch &  Aylaâ€™ s Triple Kick and just  pray you can take one 
down, heal and  take the other down before your annihilated. Thatâ€™s all the 
help I can give right now.

After the  elevator equip Red  Armour on everyone and  run from the  Orbs. 
Head around 7  collect the  Megalixir. Run from  the next fight  & head  
through the door.

Head around & Collect the Magic seal then head through the door.

Grab the items in this room and Save & Use a Shelter.

Near the top right Nu  is a Haste Helm! This Helm is  magnificent as it gives 
a character permanent Haste status. Give this Helm to Ayla for now.

In the next room  is a Tubster. This Tubster respawns every  time you leave 
the room via the exit  you just came out of, whatâ€™s more important  is that 
you can Charm a  Power Tab  each time off  this Tubster. This  Tubster isnâ€™t  
even that hard because it only counterattacks (painfully.. counterattacks)

Ideally, you  should Charm  about 160 Power  tabs off this  Tubster to  Max 
out Robo & Cronoâ€™s  Power, unless of course you are  doing a minimum-tabs 
challenge then you  need not  bother here until  you try to  tackle ocean  
palace's Lavos This will take an absolute age, so you might want to do this 
in segments.

I suggest you give your characters the following equipment for this ordeal.

Crono: Wallet
Marle : Gold Stud
Ayla : Haste Helm & Gold Stud

-Move the Revives to the top of your item list to save yourself a headache.

Use Mid Ethers  on Ayla when out of MP  and just Revive her if  her charm 
fails (and gets  killed by  the counter).  Twin charm  works well  here if  
Marle has boosted speed. Run after you charm successfully.

Now make sure you buy 99 Full Tonics from the Nu before you proceed after.

Proceed through to the next room, run  from the Metal Mutes & the Gold 
Shields, we donâ€™t care about  those. Now youâ€™ll face sets of  4 Ruminators 
ahead. GREAT! These Ruminators respawn just  like the Tubster does, but you  
only need to run into the very  near by door & return for  them to respawn. 
From these  we get 2 things.

1.) Infinite Megalixirs 
2.) 72 Tech Points a battle

I suggest  you Charm the  full 99 Megalixirs from  these. You most  likely 
will not  need  this  many,  but  you  will need  a  good  fraction  of  
this  much, especially on a minimal tabs run.

Use the following Set-Up

Crono: Rainbow & Wallet 
Marle: Siren & Hit Ring 
Ayla : Haste Helm & Charm Top

Charm  the 4  Ruminators, after  wait for  them to  kill each  other until  
one remains, then  have Marle attack that one,  hopefully stopping it  and 
have the others  attack  too. You  should  be  able  to  quickly and  
conveniently  get Marle's Life 2  here, as well as  a lifetime supply of  
Megalixirs, we're going to need a lot of these in our upcoming battles, not 
to mention for Lavos.

After your  done with your  Megalixir charming, swap  Robo back in,  and 
head back the way  you came (towards the Tubster you  were previously 
Charming power Tabs from). Make  sure you have the  White Armours equipped 
on  everyone so you survive the  Metal Mute, we donâ€™t  want to be  wasting 
all this work  donâ€™t we? Head back all the way to the Save point, save and 
heal.

You probably want to  finish charming power tabs here now  if you didn't 
finish this  job from  before, you  will want  both  Crono and  Robo at  ** 
Pwr.  Now, importantly,  if  you  want  to  attempt Ocean  Palace  Lavos  in  
a  NG+,  you definitely want  to also be  charming enough power Tabs  to also 
boost  Ayla to ** Pwr,  and also enough  speed tabs to  max her speed  too, 
there are  2 power tabs easily  available in the NG+ before  ocean palace 
however,  so getting her to 14  Speed is sufficient for  now, but would  also 
make Lavos easier  in this run too. Note,  if you are attempting a  no-tabs 
run, you must  still charm the Speed Tabs, because  there is just no  way to 
beat Lavos's  inner forms without improved speed.

Now continue  through the black omen,  running from everything and  opening 
all the  chests, there  are  several  Speed Tabs  available  in  these too,  
you'll eventually be  teleported to  a large  room with  monsters called  
Aliens which appear when stepping  on the trigger boxes,  charm these for a  
Magic Tab each, sadly however,  these enemies do not  respawn. Continue 
through as  before, and save/heal   before your next  fight. If you  are 
using  tabs, you want  to give all your Magic Tabs to Robo.

Now go save up in the next room. The next fight is a toughie.

**********
Giga Mutant
Top - 6000 Hp
Bottom - 5000 Hp
**********

Giga Mutant is pretty  much IMMUNE to all physical attacks,  only Magic will 
do any damage. Even Physical-Magic combo attacks  donâ€™t work because itâ€™s not 
that the physical  attacks miss. Itâ€™s  just that  heâ€™s got INSANE  physical 
defence. Therefore we have  no choice but to go  to magic attacks. On  top of 
everything his attack set  is pretty much  random so itâ€™s  very hard  to give 
you  a clear- cut strategy and he  counters every Magical attack made 
against  him with an absorb MP attack (less then 10 MP).

While my  previous strategy used  Lucca, I found  a more conservative  one 
with using Ayla as a tank to be more effective

Crono: White Vest, Wallet 
Robo : Haste Helm, White Mail, Gold Stud 
Ayla: Prism Helm, White Mail, Gold Erng

As I just mentioned,  Ayla's role here is to be a tank,  the survivor, open 
out with Crono and Ayla  applying a Barrier and a shield on  Ayla before 
Crono dies if possible, if not  then don't worry, now Ayla should  be able to 
comfortably survive all attacks  dealt by both bits, only an  unlucky life 
shaver+something else at  the wrong time  will do her  in. With this  have 
Ayla solely  focus on healing and  reviving, you  CAN spam Megalixirs  every 
turn but  I opted  to be much more  conservative  and relied much  more  on 
Full Tonics,  and  only used Megalixirs  when both  Characters are  damaged  
or needed  MP. Gigamutant  does have a  few attacks that  will kill Robo  in 
1 hit, so  Ayla will need  to keep reviving him,  it's almost  not worth  
healing him  unless it's  convenient or Ayla has  nothing else to  do, 
lightning bit will  help you in  that department too. Robo  should use  
relentlessly use  Shock every turn  he gets,  that's his only role this  
fight, he should not need  needed to help with  healing at all. Shock does 
~300 dmg a  hit to both parts, 20 of those  and both bits will fall, it 
doesn't  take as long  as you would think,  the Tyrano fights  are actually 
longer than this.

Now go  back & SAVE  and use a  shelter. Proceed  forth into the  elevator, 
put Ayla in your party and  give Robo the Prism Specs, Ayla the Wallet  & 
Crono the Gold Stud. If you  Face Goons, you know what to  do, 1 Beast Toss 
on  each will give you 3200  damage on  each with  Roboâ€™s max power.  If they 
aren't Goons.  Show NO mercy!

Heal up  and head out  of the elevator, give  everyone Black Armour.  Shred 
the Synchrites. When you hit  the bats youâ€™ll trigger a forced  fight with 2 
Goons. Put the Prism  Specs on Robo and deal with  them with a Beast Toss  on 
each (be quick). Now go  deal with the Tubsters  in the same way  (charm them 
beforehand if you wish), just revive before you attack.

In  the next  room  are 4  Panels.  They are  the  same as  the  ones we  
faced previously, but  a big difference this  time is how  we can deal with  
them. At ** Pwr  Crono with  the Rainbow can  one hit  kill all 4  of these  
with Falcon Hit, but we  don't to do that. By switching  to the Slasher 2 or  
Kali Blade He should do just over  1700 to all of them, which is easily  
finished off. So if you are playing with tabs, equip your characters like so:

Crono: Slasher II/Kali Blade, Black Vest, Wallet 
Robo : Terra Arm, Prism Helm, Black Mail, Gold Erng 
Ayla : Haste Helm, Black Mail, Gold Erng

If you have  boosted Ayla's Atk too, then  you must tailor down  the weapon 
too until falcon hit does  in that 1700 damage range. Now open  with Falcon 
hit and have Robo  use a  Barrier on  Ayla (the missile  attacks are  
actually magical, contraire to what you  may have thought), Ayla Charms away  
and either kills off the panels  herself with Cat  Attack, or Robo/Crono do  
it. But Robo  & Crono's primary roles  here are to  talk and purely heal,  
damage stacks up  very, very quickly and  you can easily  die, especially if 
you  are struggling to  get your first Charm off. Don't  use Ayla's regular 
attack command keep  her in the tech box, as  it'll save you  losing ATB 
time  to the  panels. Make sure  you finish off a  panel immediately  after 
charming  it, it's  imperative to  reduce their numbers at the earliest 
opportunity.

If you didn't use take, take the following setup: 
Crono: Rainbow, Black Vest, Prism Specs 
Ayla: Haste Helm, Black Mail, Gold Erng 
Robo: Titan Arm, Prism Helm, Wallet

The strategy  is the same as  before, Falcon Hit will  deal 1550 to all,  and 
a single cat attack  will finish these off, here have  Robo purely defensive, 
and Barrier him  ASAP,  and spam Megalixirs  liberally  with Robo, this  is  
just a riskier version of the with-tabs game.

Donâ€™t be  surprised if you die  here, a LLG was  never supposed to be  easy, 
no reason it should be now...

In  the following  room youâ€™ll  meet one  of  the most  boring yet  one of  
the easiest bosses in the  game. Put Ayla in your party with Robo.  All you 
need or this fight are 30 Full Tonics.

**********
Terra Mutant
20000 Hp
**********

Your Set-Up should be:

Crono: Not Red Armour, Wallet (So he dies quick!) 
Ayla : Red Mail, Charm Top 
Robo : Prism Helm, Red Mail, Gold Erng

Same set-up for with or without-tabs.

Terra Mutant  has the most sophisticated  survival mechanism I have  ever 
seen. It sucks  its own bodily fluids whilst  thrashing out at  what's 
attacking it, and  when  it runs  out  of  said bodily  fluids,  only  then 
does  it  perish. Now, with this equipment  set-up Robo is immortal if you  
keep healing him with Full Tonics,  he's too slow to  follow up any  attacks, 
even if you're  slow at pressing the item button.  Don't attack him once, as 
he  will keep draining his bottom  half,  which will  fall  after  *gulp*  
20  absorptions. This  is  very boring, but it  will happen. Heal Robo  after 
every attack sent  his way except the lava & weak absorption attacks, and 
this battle is good as won.

I only used 20 Full Tonics, if that helps you gauge how long it should take.

Now head out and prepare for your next fight, which is a little trickier.

*********
Lavos Spawn
Head - 10000 Hp
*********

Set up your characters

Crono: Slasher, Wallet
Robo : Terra Arm, Haste Helm, Blue Mail, Gold Erng 
Ayla : Prism helm, Blue Mail, Charm top

Same set-up for with or without-tabs.

The beak has a  Haste Helm which we must charm. Now  with Robo's equipment 
set- up here,  he can survive any  attack of Lavos  Spawn's, but no more  
then that. So, open  the battle  by Ayla  charming the head  and Crono  
doing.... nothing, Ayla and  Crono will get knocked  out after a  couple of 
turns, after  which do not revive them. If  Ayla doesn't get the Haste Helm 
before  she dies then just reset and try again. 

Now with Robo, thanks to  the Haste Helm he is fast enough  to get in about 
1.5 turns in for  every one of Lavos Spawn's,  if you follow the  rule 
'Attack only when  Robo is  at full  health' then  you should  comfortably 
be  able to  heal before being  nailed twice by  the Lavos Spawn, which  will 
kill Robo.  So just hold off attacks as  fast as you can with Full  
Tonics/Elixirs, and before long you'll  have a  turn with  Robo whilst  at 
Full  Health, where  you can  safely attack.  Lavosâ€™s water  attack rise  will 
only  serve to  give you  a free  turn attacking, after  7-15 Uzzi  punches, 
depending  on your  Tab usage,  the spawn will fall.

Now go back and save,  we have a tough series of fights  ahead of us, not 
least of which, Lavos! But first..

*********
Panels x5
1875 Hp each
*********

The  difficulty of  this fight  depends  on your  Tabs situation,  if you  
were thorough through  the game you should  already have easily gotten  
enough Speed Tabs to  Max out Crono Marle  & Robo, and if  you don't intend 
on  tackling the Ocean Palace  Lavos, then  those Tabs  are all  you will  
need. If  you weren't very thorough though,  or were and need  them for 
Ayla's Speed,  then count how many tabs you  do need, and only charm  that 
many, as fighting 5  panels at the same time is suicide in the long term.

Set up your characters: With-Tabs: 
Crono: Varying Weapon, Haste Helm, Black Vest, Wallet 
Robo : Titan Arm, Prism Helm, Black Mail, Gold Erng 
Ayla : Prism Helm, Black Mail, Gold Erng

Without-Tabs
Crono: Rainbow, Black Vest, Prism Specs 
Ayla: Haste Helm, Black Mail, Gold Erng 
Robo: Haste Helm, Prism Helm, Wallet

The strategy for both equipment sets are the same.

As before, open with  Falcon hit to critically damage all 5  panels, now if 
you require 3 or less panels,  use Robo's Area Bomb to clear 2  of the 
panels, of 4 then clear 1  panel with Rocket Punch, if  (God help you) 5  
then, instead have Robo  use  a Barrier  on  himself.  With  some  Ayla's 
charms  are  successful, immediately kill  the Charmed  panel with  
Rocketpunch, and  if Crono  gets any further turns have  him use Barriers on 
Robo then  Ayla. By spamming Megalixirs and attacks  you  should have a  
chance  of getting the  necessary  tabs whilst surviving the fight.

If you  need no tabs then  1 falcon hit with  the Rainbow w/ tabs  will 
finish this, or 1 Falcon hit and Shock with the second equipment set-up.

Now save & use a shelter. 

Prepare your party:

Crono: Rainbow, Haste Helm, Black Mail Haste Helm & Gold Stud 
Robo : Terra Arm, Haste Helm, Blue Mail, Gold Stud 
Ayla : Prism Helm, Black Mail, Gold Erng

If you  have ANY spare Speed  Tabs left over, give  them all to Ayla  now. 
Also note that  the no-tabs  set-up and  strategies remain exactly  the same  
as the regular playthrough,  it just takes longer  to do the  same job, and 
you  run a bigger  risk of  dying against  Zeal's final  form. But  the 
challenges  should play out very similarly.

You  probably  noticed no-one  is  wearing  the  Wallet,  that is  because  
the next boss fights give no Exp. Which is  great because Crono can now be 
used for his Confuse. 

**********
Zeal 
11500 Hp
**********

Her  obscene evasion  is made  moot  point by  our pinpoint  Beast Tosses,  
her Hallation attacks are  empty threats, as she  can only target 1  
character at a time otherwise,  so here just revive characters  that die and  
do not otherwise heal.  Use Megalixirs  to recover  MP  and have  Crono  use 
Confuse  (all 2  of them..), Queen Zeal will not last very long at all.

After this Zeal Throws you into the Mammon Machine.

**********
Mammon Machine
18000 Hp
*********

Mammon machine is  very hard if you don't  know what you are  doing, but 
that's where I come in!

Now,  the Mammon  Machine  has 2  phases. Modifying  Phase  & Attacking  
Phase. Using any Magical attacks during  the Modifying Phase will increase  
the Mammon Machineâ€™ s Attack power  in the Attack  phase & using  any 
Physical Attacks  increases the Mammon Machineâ€™s defence during said Attack 
Phase.

During  the  modifying   phase  you  will  do  nothing   except  revive  
fallen characters using a Megalixir to recover MP.

When the  mammon machine  releases its  stored energy, Ayla  will be  the 
lone survivor.  Do not  bother  healing,  have Ayla  immediately 
revive  Robo followed by  Crono. Have Robo  use 3 Uzzi Punches  (1400 damage) 
and  have Ayla use 1  or 2 Triple Kicks  and Crono his 2  Confuses, depending 
on if  your fast enough). Soon  youâ€™ll  be hit by  2  Point Flares (kills  
one  character each). Ignore  the fallen  characters and  continue  your 
onslaught  until the  Mammon machine switches  back into  its modifying  
phase, where  you just  repeat the above process.  If you follow this 
process  the Mammon machine  will fall after 3-6 cycles.

All in all this battle just takes a little while.

*********
Zeal
Head: 20000 Hp
*********

This  form is  nothing like  the previous  2 fights,  Zeal is  by all  
accounts absolutely lethal, and must be treated with respect!

Now, start  the  fight with Crono  using  a Megalixir, Robo  Uzzi  Punching 
the Head & Ayla Charming a Prism Dress from  the left hand (and thus get hit 
by it â€™ s counter). Now here are the list of attacks:

2 Different Shadow  Laser attacks: Healing to Ayla &  Crono, hurts Robo 130- 
180 Shadow Gear: Heals Crono & Ayla and Kills Robo Hexagon  Mist: Kills  
Crono,  Heals Robo  and sometimes  kills  Ayla (Ayla  can usually survive 
this from Full Hp) Stargate / Lighting: Kills a Single character Halation - 
Hp of all characters goes to 1

Itâ€™s a very  good thing indeed that you  got 2 Haste Helms.  Because these 
make this battle  much easier. Now  your absolute priority  in this fight  
should be to  revive  any  fallen  character  immediately,   you  can't  
afford  to  lose character's turns  due to them  being dead. Your  second 
priority should  be to keep healing  with Megalixirs.  Ayla will  survive 
Hexagon  Mist from  full Hp, but if she  dies instead then you have  a Lone 
Robo, who might  be fast enough o revive  and recover  if you are  lucky, 
but you  are very  vulnerable indeed. Robo  can also  survive the  single  
shadow lasers  from full  Hp, being  fully healed here is a big advantage.

Only then  do  you have permission  to  attack. Crono has  his  Confuse 
attack, Robo Uzzi Punch and Ayla Triple kick, target the head only. 

Basically if  you keep priority in  reviving fallen characters with  your 
first available  character, and  using  Megalixirs/Uzzi Punch/Confuse  when 
you  have your characters available,  this battle  will not be  so tough. 
The  best way  to go about the battle is to ONLY target the head.

If  you get  hit by  Halation,  pretend it  never happened  because you  
should assume all attacks  that hit you that  you canâ€™t absorb,  will kill, 
the only  form of healing to  Hp should be  Megalixirs, which are  primarily 
there to  recover MP for all party members.
Basically below is the list of the roles of the 3 characters.

Robo: Uzzi Punches the Head & Revives on demand ONLY 
Crono:  Uses Confuse  on  the Head  and  uses Megalixirs  +  Revives on  
demand 
Ayla: Only uses Revives & Megalixirs on demand ONLY

After  Zeal falls  youâ€™ll  go up  against  Lavos,  who will  take  the form  
of previous bosses you fight.

*********
Lavos (Hedgehog Form)
*********

Swap Ayla out for Frog & Give Robo the Prism Specs & Crono the Sun Shades

Dragon Tank:
Attack each bit once..

Guardian & Bite:
Single Uzzi Punch to the Main Body

Heckran:
2 Shocks off Robo

Zombor:
Single Uzzi Punch on each bit is enough

Masa & Mune:
Regularly attack it a few times..

Zombor:
Crono uses Lightning & Robo uses Uzzi Punch Twice & Frog Leap Slashes once

Magus:
Robo can do Fire (Mega Bomb) Lightning (Shock) and Shadow (Laser Spin)  and 
Frog can do  Water, then use Uzzi  punch & Leap Slash  and he shouldnâ€™t get a 
single Dark Matter in.

Tyrano & Azala:
Gold Stud & Red Armour for all.  Kill Azala with Shock & Annihilate Tyrano 
with your favourite techs.

Keep Red Mail on all and pummel the middle.

Actual Lavos (10000 Hp):

Equip Robo & Ayla:

Robo: Haste Helm, Nova Armour, Gold Erng 
Ayla: Prism Helm, Prism Dress, Gold Erng

This set-up should allow Robo & Ayla to survive all attacks thrown at them.

Start out with Robo using Uzzi Punch & Ayla standing by.

Basically just  have  Robo constantly use  Uzzi  Punch on every  turn  he 
gets. Ayla should be fast  enough to get turns against Lavos in a  1:1 ratio. 
So Ayla should  wait until  Lavos  uses an  attack, then  use  a Megalixir  
immediately after it. This will keep your HP & MP both full throughout.

Now  as soon  as you  get in,  you will  SAVE and  exit through  the gate,  
you obviously.. need to make a few preparations before the final showdown.

Lavos Preparation & Lavos Final Battle
***********

It's been a long  road, but the moment of truth has  finally arrived! Lavos 
may have been  quite straightforward,  if epic  in your  regular gameplays,  
but he really is a most lethal animal in a LLG.

Both the  second and  final forms of  Lavos have many,  many attacks  that 
will wipe  your party  off  the  map in    single hit,  and  there  is no  
possible equipment set-up that  can change this. We had a  similar situation 
with Magus' Dark Matter all  the way back then, but  we were able to work  
around that with our Barriers. This  time, we have Crono, Marle &  Robo's 
triple tech, Lifeline, which is as it says, literally our only hope of 
winning this. 

Furthermore this  is where the  no-tabs game ends,  there is absolutely  no 
way to win  this short of  using Magus without  using any  Tabs, as your  
party are blown off  the  battlefield before they  can  get any chance  of  
a foot- hold, boosting Robo's  Speed is  imperative, and we  will be needing  
to make  use of those Speed Tabs right now if you haven't already.

You  can attempt a  'minimal  tabs' run by  giving  Robo just 5  Speed  Tabs 
and nobody anything  else, use the  same equipment list  as the regular  LLG 
except you will now need  to use that Swallow you took earlier,  and all the 
hardships you have  had  to endure. I  haven't  myself play tested this  
perfectly  yet, I simply  used a  Slasher and  Speed/Power  Tabs to  get  the 
same  stats as  the Swallow, but  I can confirm  from that it  is possible.  
I will include  a more detailed strategy  with my  next update  if there  is 
sufficient  interest for this, but it should  play our very similarly to a 
regular  LLG, except you have much less  margin for  error, and  when Lavos'  
body activates  you need  to be prepared as it can splash attacks faster than 
you can Lifeline them.

If  you are  playing a  regular LLG,  you  want to  Max out  Crono and  
Marle's Speed, and  get Robo to 15  speed, no more and  no less. You should  
have their PWR's maxed out already.

You will need
Minimum of 
40 Megalixirs 
30 Revives 
5 Heals 
Battle Speed 8 (slowest) 
A healthy dose of luck

Equip your characters:

Crono: Rainbow, Haste Helm, Red Vest, Gold Stud 
Marle: Prism Helm, Red Mail, Gold Stud 
Robo : Terra Arm, Haste Helm, Red Mail, Green Dream

Go to 1999 AD via the Bucket or Epoch, whichever you fancy.

*********
Lavos Form 2
Body: 25000 Hp
Left Arm: 7000 Hp
Right Arm: 9000 Hp
*********

There is a  good reason why Robo is at  15 and not ** Speed, and  that is, if 
a character with  Auto-Revive status dies with  his turn available, then  
when he is revived, his ATB bar  is set back to zero and he  loses his Haste 
status for that  first  turn  he has  after  being  revived,  this  is not  
the  case  for partially  full,  or full  but  without  the  turn  available, 
ATB  bars.  This affects you  hugely in this  battle, and because of  this is 
why  'saving' your character's turns  is not beneficial.  It's usually 
better  to use any  junk on your turn  (Megalixirs  are usually a  good  bet) 
left save  being  killed with that turn  open, and having  to wait a  long 
time  before you get  another turn with that character again.

That aside now, so you run into Lavos,  who greets you with Lavos Beams / 
Doors of Doom  Open  attack. And completely  level  your party, before  you  
can even move! So much for lifelining our way to victory..

Not quite

Robo has  been equipped with  the Green Dream, which lets  us cling on,  now 
you must  move  quickly, Robo  needs  to  revive Crono  and  use  a Full  
Tonic  on himself.  He  should  be  able  to  do this  thanks  to  Haste  
and  our  speed manipulation.

Now Lavos will  lash out with his two  sickles, after which only  Crono or 
Robo will survive  (Robo  has enough def  and  health, barely, to  survive  1 
Sickle attack). Now  that character revives Marle  1st, and then the  other 
character, now cast  Lifeline, well  in time for  Lavos' second wave  of 
sickles.  You can probably  squeeze  a Confuse  attack  in  with  Crono  (on  
the Left  Arm)  and Megalixir  with Robo  here  before  they  hit, after  
which  you want  to  cast Lifeline  again. Lavos  will wipe  you  out once  
again and  Lifeline will  now revive all three  characters. If you made  it 
this far, well  done, you finally got yourself a (fragile) foothold in this 
steep battle for the future!

Now,  Lavos' body  is in  its  engaging phase,  and  will not  issue any  
more attacks until  it has done so,  which is a few  turns away. The arms  
too, will not attack  for a  while, I suggest  you hold off  casting 
Lifeline  again just yet and  go all-out on the  left arm, you really  need 
to take this  out before the body  engages, as  the three  parts together  
easily overwhelm  the party. This should  be quite easy, have Crono  Confuse 
every turn and  Robo Uzzi Punch, Marle doesn't have  auto-haste but 
conveniently gets in 1  Megalixir for every 2 of Crono's  and Robo's 
attacks, dedicate Marle to  be your Megalixir spammer. The left  arm should  
quickly fall, even  without using any  Tabs. Now  you are safe to  restablish 
lifeline.  Go all-out on  the right arm  and you  should be able  to take  
that down  before  or just  after  the main  body engages  (and performs his 
powerful  party-targeting fire attack, which we  absorb thanks to our 
armours).

The  right arm  shouldnâ€™t take  too  much longer  than  the left  arm did,  
your priority is  to make sure  at least 2  characters have auto-revive  
status from lifeline, whenever 2 characters lose it,  make it your absolute 
priority to re- establish Lifeline.  With both arms  gone, hack through  
those 25k Hp  the body has,  you should  be easily  fast enough  to re-
establish  lifeline before  the next  party-lethal attack.  Reviving  fallen 
characters,  like  the Queen  Zeal battle, should remain our #1 priority.

**********
Lavos Form 3
Left Bit: 3000 Hp
Centre Bit: 10000 Hp
Right Bit (Core) 30000 Hp
**********

This battle  will go  similarly to  the first. Basically  the first  thing 
that should be on your  mind is *Lifeline*. Bring it up ASAP,  hopefully 
Crono has 4 or more MP  left when you enter this  battle allowing you to  
cast Lifeline off the bat. If not then you got a  bumpy start, use a 
Megalixir straight away with Crono  or Robo  and wait  for  his turn  to  
become available  again then  cast Lifeline. If the  bits keep picking you 
off with  single attacks, keep reviving until everyone has their turn, then 
get Lifeline up.

Now repeat the  process you did previously,  only this time youâ€™re  going to 
need to  use Lifeline  a  bit  more  because the  Bits  attack you  more  
frequently (everything is  a 1 Hit Kill except  Evil Star, which  basically 
does nothing). Again if  2 or more  characters have been  relieved of Auto-
Life,  get Lifeline up again as soon as possible. 

Before you  start attacking,  be aware of  Lavosâ€™s party-hitting  attacks, 
these are  dependent on  where  we  go  with Lavos's  Time  Warp, which  
changes  the background. They are as follows:

65000000 BC Jungle - Grand Stone - Kills Party 
600 AD - Magus's Castle - Evil Star - Halves Parties' HP 
1000 AD -  Leene Square - Kills Crono,  Marle, Robo can survive,  with a 
random status (use a Heal) 
2400 AD - Lab Ruins - Dreamless - Kills Party 
12000 BC  - Mammon Machine -  Invading Light - Kills  Party - Needs all  3 
bits alive.

Basically, everything here  floors your party except Death Star,  which you 
can just ignore,  if Lavos warps  to 12000 BC  without a  bit present, he  
will not launch that attack  until the bits are  revived, after which you  
have a couple of turns  before that happens. You  can manipulate this by  
immediately killing off the  small bit when  it's revived and  causing Lavos  
to be *stuck*,  as he cannot time  warp  again until he  launches  the 
attack. You  can  buy yourself many easy turns attack this way although it's 
not essential.

Now, focus on  taking the Left Bit  out first, Crono's Confuse  and Robo's 
Uzzi Punch should make  short work of it, even  without Power Tabs. Now  you 
want to heal  up and  make sure  lifeline is  on  all 3  members while  
waiting for  the core's defence  to go down,  from then you  will go  all-out 
on the  right core until  it revives  the  left bit,  completely  ignore the  
centre  bit in  this battle, it's not worth touching him.

Always make  sure your Lifeline is  up on at least  2 characters at a  time 
and you should  pull through  just fine  here, donâ€™t  take any  more risks  
then you must, you really donâ€™t want to keep redo-ing the previous battle.

Eventually the  Core WILL  fall, CONGRATULATIONS! You  completed the  Low 
Level Game challenge!

Enjoy your ending!

Extras!

What better  way to finish  off this FAQ  then to  include a couple  of 
battles that  you are  really not  supposed  to fight.  Let's begin  with 
the  easiest, you'll need access to cheats for this:

**>-28-<***
Spekkio, Pink Nu Form
20000 Hp
***********

Have you  ever wondered what  it would be  like to face  the Pink Nu  with 
your feebly-levelled party? Well, sadly  we need a party member at  Level ** 
in order for him  to appear, which  is just not possible  without using 
cheats,  but the Pink Nu  can be  tackled with a  legitimate Low-Level party  
once you  get that part out  of the  way. I will  not detail how  to do 
exactly  here until  I get someone  who is  good with  cheat codes,  but 
essentially  you need  to make  a character (Magus)  Level ** and  in the 
lead  of the  party when you  enter the room,  then turn off  the  code and 
swap  Magus  out for your  party  of Crono, Marle and Robo at levels 1, 4 and 
16.

Equip them as follows:
Crono: Rainbow, Haste Helm, White Mail Gold Stud 
Marle: Haste Helm, White Mail, Gold Stud 
Robo: Red Mail, Gold Stud/Prism Specs

You will need:
10 Megalixirs
10 Revives

Now  you  probably  want  to  keep resetting  this  until  Spekkio  opens  
with Luminaire, after  which you should  have time to  revive Robo and  get 
Lifeline online. After which you  want to fight in a very similar manner  to 
how you did against Lavos,  except you  will be  attacking exclusively  with 
Ice  Sword I/II and Robo's  Shock, as  single physical  attacks are  
ineffective. Robo  is your least useful character  here, so have his  main 
role to be  to spam Megalixirs. Spekkio has  Hallation and  Salt, which  are 
practically free  turns for  us to attack him,  because  Spekkio deals such  
obscene  damage that it  if  we can't absorb it, we'd  surely be seeing five  
digit damage if the  game's engine were capable of it!

So,  always keep  lifeline  active so  that  at least  2  players will  
survive anything, and you  should have ample opportunity to attack  and 
whittle away at that 20k health of his.


**>-29-<***
Ocean Palace Lavos
30000 Hp
***********

Probably the  hardest monster you  can ever face, sadly  this is just  not 
even remotely  possible on  our first-playthrough  as  we need  practically 
all  the equipments that  are not available  until later  in the game,  
actually scratch that he's  *barely* beatable even with all  the equipments 
later  on too! Think of your  hardest battle in this LLG  challenge, and 
multiply  its difficulty by about ten, that's roughly how hard this battle is.

Ocean  Palace  Lavos  isn't  *meant*  to be  beatable  by  a  regular  or  
even overleveled  playthrough, and  sure as  hell wasn't  intended for  a 
Low  Level Party. But I wouldn't be writing here if it was impossible 
wouldn't !

AFAIK Xuxon  and I were the  first players successful  in taking him down  in 
a LLG, the original thread is still available as I write this: 
http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/563538-chrono-trigger/42693858 But  this 
strategy  is realistically  only feasible  with an  emulator, and  by abusing 
save states, you rely on luck the entire battle on Lavos not targeting Ayla. 

So  instead I  have come  up with  a  much more  sound strategy,  which can  
be played from  start to  finish even on  a SNES console,  it still  requires 
some luck at the start,  but the outcome after that is entirely  in your 
hands. This is why  you need to  play through the  game twice, to  get a 
third  Haste Helm, it's mandatory for this strategy to work.

You need:
50 Heals
50 Shields
99 Revives
99 Megalixirs

Crono & Robo set to using items in the Menu memory.

Crono &  Ayla at **  Speed, Robo can  be 15 or  **, depending on  how 
seriously you want  the developers ending,  15 if you  are serious, doing  
this increases the  difficulty by  about 2x  but guarantees  you a  
definitive chance  against Lavos' second form's attack without resorting to 
random resetting.

You need exactly the following equipment set-up:

Crono: Rainbow, Haste Helm, Green Dream 
Robo: Terra Arm, Haste Helm, Nova Armor, Frenzy Band 
Ayla: Haste Helm, Prism Dress, Gold Erng

There is  no equipment set-up that allows  Ayla to survive  Lavos' DRFTH 
attack without a  Shield, or Auto-Protect  (Safe Helm), and  we are 
completely  at the mercy of  our ATB  bars when Lavos  launches his initial  
attack, if  Crono has his  turn available  when  DRFTH comes,  we are  
screwed.  Furthermore we  need Lavos' first Needles  attack to hit Robo not  
Ayla, but that's all  the luck we will need,  the rest  is up to  you. To get 
this battle to open how we need it to, go back and fight/run away from the 
monsters at the switches to change the battle parameters.

Now  with this set-up  Ayla has  no status protection, sadly  there  is no 
way around  this and hence  Chaotic  Zone will always Confuse Ayla, 
fortunately we can work around this.

For the opening:
Lavos Uses Destruction Rains from the Heavens (DRFTH) 
Crono gets his turn immediately and revives Robo 
Crono uses a Megalixir Lavos uses  Chaotic Zone  - Kills Crono  - Robo 
should  counter attack  450 dmg 
Robo Revives Ayla Robo uses Shield on Ayla 
Lavos Uses Needles, *Must* Hit Robo 
Ayla uses a Megalixir 
Ayla waits until Lavos uses DRFTH

Lavos will then repeat his cycle over and over: 
DRFTH - 500 Dmg to a shielded Ayla 
Chaotic Zone - 150 to Robo and Ayla, confuses Ayla 
Needles - Kills 1 character 
And he will launch those  attacks at **  Speed, same speed as your non-hasted 
Ayla.

Needles cannot be  survived regardless of what equipment set-up  we use, 
sadly. And by itself makes  the battle very tricky due to its  random nature 
and risk of  killing  Ayla. When  Ayla  dies  she loses  her  shield,  she 
needs  to  be revived, healed  and re-shielded, that's 3 whole  turns. AND 
we  have the DRFTH of Lavos'  next cycle breathing  down our necks that  we 
have to  survive, with Ayla having time to react too.

You have to really  be on the ball to survive this case.  Now continue with 
his pattern.  Now at  the  end of  Lavos's  opening  cycle we  have  a 
hasted  Ayla instead of  Crono standing,  it's that  difference that allows  
us to  make our counter-attack.

*Start Point*
1.) Ayla holds her turn ready 
2.)Lavos Uses DRFTH 
3.)Ayla immediately revives Robo 
4.)Ayla WAITS with her turn until Robo is 60% complete ATB bar 
5.)Ayla uses a Megalixir 
6.)Lavos uses Chaotic  Zone - Confuses and  Hurts Ayla, Robo will  80% 450 
(900 crit) dmg counter attack 
7.)Robo should get his turn reasonably safely  before Ayla, uses a Heal on 
Ayla 
8.)Ayla revives Crono 
9.)Robo wait with his turn 
10.) Ayla  inputs Triple  Kick if  she gets  her next  turn before  Lavos 
(Fast Fingers!!) 1
1).Lavos uses Needles, Kills one character 
12.) If  Ayla gets  her turn  during this animation,  then select  Triple 
Kick, which will hit immediately after Needles

Now this  is where  things get  tricky, you  really need  to move  your 
fingers quickly here, and what you do will depend on who Lavos targets

Ayla:
Lavos kills Ayla (and makes Steps 10 & 12 Void) 
Robo immediately revives Ayla 
Crono Uses Megalixir 
Robo uses Shield on Ayla 
Crono *might* be fast enough to get in a Spincut (1000) 
Lavos  Uses DRFTH, Ayla  should  just about get  her  turn on cue,  go  back 
to Start Point

Robo:
Lavos kills Robo
First of Ayla & Crono uses a Megalixir 
Second of Ayla & Crono uses a Shield 
Ayla Waits  with her turn  (her ATB bar  might not  quite fill if  you 
selected Triple Kick at step 10 before DRFTH) 
Crono *might* be fast enough to get in a Spincut (1000) 
Lavos Uses DRFTH, Ayla should get her turn on cue, go back to Start Point

Crono:
Lavos kills Crono
Ayla Triple Kicks
Robo uses a Megalixir
Ayla Triple Kicks
Robo uses a Shield on Ayla 
Lavos  Uses DRFTH, Ayla  should  just about get  her  turn on cue,  go  back 
to Start Point

You are  not always going to  be fast enough  to make your attacks,  Lavos' 
ATB bar does  not move when  you are in  the Items & Techs  Menu, but it  
does move when you're moving between  them on first command screen, you  need 
to spend as little time in  there as humanly possible,  often you will not  
be fast enough, and thus  will have to sacrifice  one or all of  your attacks 
just to  get into Sync again.  But don't beat  yourself too much  losing 
multiple cycles  with no Attacks, Robo's  counter attack will effectively  
whittle away at  Lavos' health and will cumulate a  decent number at the end 
of this, especially  if he hits a few criticals.

Ayla can afford to  have a partially (75%+) full ATB bar  when DRFTH comes, 
but no less,  as she will  not be able  to get her  Megalixir in after  she 
revives Robo.  If  you find  yourself  in  a critical  state  and  might not  
make  the Megalixir in  time, then do  not make the pause  before using the  
Megalixir at Step 4, use the following emergency pattern:

3.)Ayla immediately revives Robo 
4a.)Ayla uses a Megalixir
 5a.)Lavos uses Chaotic Zone - Confuses and Hurts Ayla 
6a.)Ayla randomly attacks 
7a.)Robo heals Ayla 
8a.)Ayla/Robo revives Crono 
9.)Wait for Lavos Needles 
10.) If  Ayla falls, use  the standard pattern,  if Robo/Crono falls,  have 
the survivor use  a Megalixir  and Shield, in  that order, and  have Ayla  
wait out DRFTH (Sacrifice your attacking opportunity) 
11.) Lavos Uses DRFTH, go back to Start Point

Your best  attacking  chances will be  from  when Crono is  targeted,  but 
you should have enough  items to last 50 cycles,  so if you average  just 
over 1000 damage a  round and don't  take any more  risks, you  should be 
able  to finish him, eventually.

This took  me many, many resets,  and is by  a country mile the  hardest 
battle possible in  Crono Trigger,  I only  know a  handful of  other people  
who have managed this, if you win, well done!

Now if you want  the developers ending... best of luck,  use same strategies 
as described in  the original  Lavos section,  except give  Marle the  third 
Haste Helm. Hopefully  you have  enough Megalixirs  and luck to  see this  
through. I haven't done this yet myself,  and I only know of 1 person  that 
had as I write this, join the elite band!

**>-30-<***
Lower Levels - The Theory
***********

As far as reducing  the minimum levels even further go, I  am most certain 
that this work  is finished. Quite  recently I have managed  to get an  excel 
format of  this  working  quite  well,  with all  the  relevant  experience  
mechanics programmed in.  I havenâ€™t managed  yet to find  an automated method  
of checking every single encounter combination, but my iterative theory goes 
as follows.

Chrono must remain at level 1 Marle must finish at level 4 Ayla must finish 
at level 20

These final  lowest levels  are very  trivially proven even  by pen  and 
paper, it's impossible to get  any of these 3 characters at a  lower level 
then stated in this FAQ,  no matter how you shuffle the  EXP, it's 
impossible. Additionally it's almost impossible  that sacrificing a level off 
Crono  and Marle will make an improvement of more  than 1 level elsewhere, but 
that  WILL affect your Lavos battle  average. Additionally  Ayla  always 
absorbs  the  maximum  exp she  can here, and thus cannot sacrifice another 
level intentionally even if she tried.

So that  leaves us  with Frog,  Lucca's and  Robo's levels  that have  room 
for tinkering, and  judging by the end game  experience buffers, Lucca  is 
the best candidate for squeezing  an additional level out of. But  her party 
position in almost all her  battles is all but  forced, and even tinkering  
with Marle's 110 exp  buffer isnâ€™t  having  the desired  effect,  Lucca needs  
to  save exp  just before the Magus  battle, but she cannot afford  to be in 
the Main  party to do so because of Crono and Marle.

Frog and  Robo are  similar affairs,  but requiring  much greater  exp 
savings, fiddling with  the exp again  yielded negative  results with the  
excel charts, which agree perfectly game results.

Basically  the final  party  levels of  1  4 15  15  16 20  37  are the  
lowest possible withstanding the  maximum level of scrutiny I can  give it. 
If anybody wants to  attempt to refute this,  please contact me  and I'll 
give you  what I have to give you the best chance to do so.

Accepting this I have  always wanted to trivialize the Nizbel  II fight, if 
you ever want  to see  how painstaking  that fight  once was,  you need  only 
watch MoogleBoss's take on  the fight. And the accomplishment  of safely 
accommodating the extra exp needed for this has most certainly warranted this 
update.

Author's Notes
***********
Chrono Trigger is  always a game  I will hold close to  my heart and  I am 
glad to be a  small part of the community of  players it has. I would  like 
to thank QHorvik on his  so far excellent LP which  had spurred me to  
rewrite this FAQ. I was quite frankly  embarrassed at my writing style a 
long  way back, but most definitely proud.

There are many  people who have supported me throughout  the production of 
this guide,  in  particular   the  earlier  versions,  that  I  wish   I  
had  fully acknowledged and credited,  and now too far  in the past to  fully 
remember who they were.  But if  any of you  who I  have not mentioned  do 
come  across this version of the FAQ, be known that you have been most 
gratefully appreciated.

Credits
***********
CyberSarkany -  A substantial amount of  play testing and refining the  order 
of doing several things,  including grabbing chests and when to  save. Also 
helped in no small  part with the Magus Strategy  at both 600A.D. and  12000 
B.C. Also for showing  how to end  battles quickly on Zenan  Bridge. Probably 
a  few more things than  I do wish  I remembered, please contact  me if you  
stumble across this FAQ!

Xuxon  - Extensive  Ocean Palace  Lavos  discussion, and  for breaking  
through with the first successful attempt in a LLG.

Moogleboss  - For his  video  documentation of the  challenge  and 
play testing, for suggesting to use Power Tabs on Magus when struggling.

TrynaBeFunny - In  his DS version of the  LLG FAQ, for pointing out  a 15 
Speed Robo is superior to a ** Speed Robo, and for crediting some of my 
strategies.

Unknown  -  For  suggesting  the  original   Nizbel  II  strategy  used,  
with Attacking 3x  and Lightning  3x on  Nizbel, a  tedious but  successful 
strategy that stood for 7 years.

Jellyslayer &  Others -  For reminding me  of the new  Nizbel II  strategy, 
now made possible by exp shuffling

QHorvik -  For his  excellent LP on  a LLG, also  for play testing  the 
original ocean palace  Lavos strategies, and for  motivating me to publish  
this update. Also  for  his board  members  who  explained  the  mechanics 
of  avoiding  the encounter just before Nizbel (at the door)

Fast Blood  - For  reminding me  of the trick  to avoid  the buggers  battle 
in Proto Dome.

Crinkles - For  his original LLG FAQ, the original  and still mainstream 
Second and Third Lavos forms strategy, and use of Berserker for the R-Series.

The n00b Avenger - For helpful forum discussions in the first few versions, 
and for his Level/Stat chart which enabled me to compute the theoretical exp 
margins rather painlessly.

If anybody else  has helped me with this, especially  from 2005, please 
contact me so I may credit you.

Final Notes
***********

I will  safely say  this is one  of the  last updates to  this FAQ,  there 
will variations based on  this format made available for the  iPhone 
platform, which I have played myself  very enjoyably. Watch out for these  if 
you are intending on playing on such platforms.
